an actor before becoming a 84
an arrow pointing toward a 98
an empty street through a 55
an empty street without a 56
an enemy without injuring a 44
an evening passed without a 91
an evening stroll through a 41
an image viewed through a 43
an input device called a 94
an uneasy spirit without a 53
as blood passes through a 53
as every person shewed a 42
as every person showed a 49
as every player stakes a 99
as light passes through a 690
as might justly become a 60
as though debating whether i 64
as though viewed through a 209
as though weighing whether i 51
as water passes through a 281
at about sunset opened a 69
at cairo seemed almost a 49
at every second flight a 89
at every street corner a 66
at first almost seemed a 65
at first formed merely a 43
at first glance appears a 113
at first glance merely a 83
at first glance seemed a 160
at first glance whether a 122
at first passed through a 44
at first passes through a 46
at first seemed merely a 79
at night without carrying a 51
at which charge passes a 48

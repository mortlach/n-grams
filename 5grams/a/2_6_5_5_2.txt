am afraid solid learning is 42
am already getting tired of 58
am always taken aback by 46
am always talking about the 114
am always thinking about it 96
am always thinking about my 49
am always thinking about the 190
am deeply sorry about the 89
am myself daily growing in 40
am simply talking about the 71
an abrupt phase change of 47
an abrupt turning point in 86
an absurd story about the 49
an accord under which the 43
an active agent within the 131
an active force tending to 113
an active force which is 44
an active force within the 214
an active group within the 56
an active social force in 64
an active thinking image of 171
an actual breach either of 86
an actual place where the 51
an actual right which the 133
an actual value equal to 81
an actual working model of 145
an affair about which no 62
an affair which ended in 59
an affair which might be 140
an affair which ought to 44
an affair which seems to 48
an agency thereof shall be 50
an agency which could be 62
an agency which might be 54
an agency which seeks to 49
an agency which works on 43
an agency which would be 153
an agreed period after the 52
an agreed price which is 60
an allied nation would be 42
an allied state might be 41
an almost awful sense of 75
an almost blank sheet of 50
an almost blind trust in 41
an almost daily basis as 186
an almost daily basis at 70
an almost daily basis by 168
an almost daily basis in 419
an almost daily basis is 43
an almost daily basis the 56
an almost daily basis to 277
an almost daily change of 50
an almost daily event in 58
an almost daily habit of 45
an almost daily round of 40
an almost daily stream of 72
an almost daily visit to 64
an almost eerie sense of 124
an almost empty glass of 57
an almost empty house of 75
an almost equal change in 75
an almost equal claim to 103
an almost equal force of 52
an almost equal level of 89
an almost equal period of 41
an almost equal place in 48
an almost equal share in 101
an almost equal share of 350
an almost equal state of 55
an almost exact image of 51
an almost exact model of 66
an almost exact repeat of 139
an almost giddy sense of 137
an almost human scream of 43
an almost human sense of 43
an almost level plain of 44
an almost solid block of 198
an almost solid front of 63
an almost solid layer of 44
an almost solid sheet of 73
an almost steady growth in 42
an almost steady stream of 207
an almost total blank in 49
an almost total change in 403
an almost total change of 168
an almost total decay of 42
an almost total denial of 111
an almost total focus on 65
an almost total state of 77
an almost total waste of 66
an already strong sense of 124
an amount about equal to 1044
an amount below which the 48
an amount fully equal to 166
an amount nearly equal to 1024
an amount nearly twice as 57
an amount quite equal to 60
an amount thereof equal to 48
an amount which added to 48
an amount which could be 556

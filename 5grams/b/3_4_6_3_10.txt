being more active and enterprising 44
being nothing simply and absolutely 888

being well pleased that providence 72
both birth weight and gestational 116
both bone marrow and peripheral 200
both free recall and recognition 95
both from policy and inclination 77
both from reasoning and experience 50

both their common and scientific 62
both their duties and temptations 74
both their origin and destination 69
both their rights and obligations 57

but also beyond its boundaries 46
but also extend and straighten 86
but also fruits and vegetables 51

but their design was discovered 68
but their design was frustrated 49
but their number and arrangement 64
but their number and importance 74
but their number was negligible 101
but their number was relatively 76
but their vanity and presumption 44
but these changes are relatively 87
but these changes are reversible 56
but these events are relatively 41

bands were playing their loudest 47
basis from every other science 57
began soon after their arrival 78
birds must needs vary according 61
black rain cloud were brought 70
blunt tusk would sink deepest 41
board will yield their faithful 40
boats were fifty feet asunder 54
bones from which these muscles 44
bones were still held together 44

books have often been written 67
books have since been written 114
bowling along still more rapidly 54
breaking down tasks into smaller 55
breaking open doors upon following 133

brood nine times nine thousand 66
brows like waifs their spirits 41
built their nests there because 63
built their roads more solidly 41
burst into flame upon contact 44
burst into flame when exposed 165
butting their large heads together 90

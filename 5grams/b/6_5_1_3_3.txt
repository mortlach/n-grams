babies under a year old 408
ballad about a man who 81
battle which i had with 62
battle which i now lay 74
became aware i was being 87
became aware i was not 45
became quite a new man 56
become quite a new man 69
before creating a new one 386
before finding a new job 151
before finding a way out 61
before getting a job with 73
before getting a new one 109
before given a man this 42
before issuing a new one 42
before known a man who 56
before landing a job with 182
before opening a new one 196
before reaching a dead end 56
before which i bow with 43
before which i can not 49
before which i did not 58
behind which a man was 51
behind which i can not 42
behind which i had hid 48
behind which i was lying 48
belief which i can not 48
bended knees i ask you 58
better after a bath and 70
better after a hot bath 50
better after a long day 83
better marry a man who 41
better shake a leg and 78
better since i saw you 195
beyond anything i can say 147
beyond anything i had yet 67
beyond which a man can 218
beyond which a man may 81
beyond which i can not 1437
beyond which i did not 142
beyond which i was not 102
bigger since i had sat 57
bitter truths i can not 41
blessing which a man can 57
boughs which i had cut 224
bought about a year ago 107
bought quite a few things 59
bounds which i can not 180
breeds twice a year and 40
breeze after a hot day 55
brogue which i had had 44
bronze after i was dead 60
brother lived a long way 46
brother sinning a sin not 176
building which i had not 52
burden which i can not 105

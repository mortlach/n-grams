came down from london yesterday 80
came from such widely separated 84
came home from church yesterday 87
came home from school complaining 145
came home from school yesterday 139
cast among such rustic barbarians 43
cent were high school graduates 279
come down from earlier centuries 41
come down from remote antiquity 221
come from other nordic countries 53
come from such widely different 54
come from such widely separated 67
come from those initial fantasies 78
come upon such curious barbarism 43
coming down some marble staircase 85
cost from some zealous supporter 42
crew were seen dropping themselves 67

came aboard and took the 85
came aboard our ship to 40
came across and took the 60
came across each other at 97
came across each other by 43
came across each other in 225
came across her face as 177
came across her name in 53
came across her poems at 52
came across him when he 115
came across his face as 282

came across his mind of 51
came across his mind the 57
came across his name in 136
came across his work in 56
came across one case in 61
came across one case of 83
came across that kind of 72
came across them only the 58
came across this book in 52
came across this kind of 96
came across this sort of 44
came across this type of 56
came almost too late to 108
came another cry from the 41
came around and gave me 135
came around and gave us 74
came around and said he 122
came around and said to 52
came around and said we 42
came around and told me 311

came around his desk to 605
came ashore and went to 51
came before and during the 70
came before and what is 92
came before her eyes as 112
came before him during the 59
came before him from the 51
came before him when he 84
came before his eyes as 54
came before his eyes in 230
came before his eyes the 77
came before them were of 55
came before they knew it 46
came blinking out into the 116
came boldly out into the 47
came bounding and banging up 54
came bounding out from the 61
came bounding out into the 98
came bustling out from the 49
came bustling out into the 41
came charging out from the 67

came closer than most of 64
came closer than most to 110
came crawling out from the 47
came creeping out from the 56
came floating out from the 101
came floating out into the 46
came grinning with pain to 51
came heavily and fell in 393
came hurrying out from the 149
came hurrying out into the 66
came hurrying out upon the 47
came inside and shut the 91
came plumes and cloth of 70
came prancing out from the 57
came pretty near making me 83
came sallying out from the 78
came second and third in 66
came shooting out from the 57
came slowly and late to 43
came slowly out from the 95
came slowly out into the 103
came sooner than even he 42
came spilling out into the 45
came spilling out onto the 46
came streaming out from the 44
came streaming out into the 65
came through and fell by 56
came through and gave me 52

came barreling around the corner 245
came careening around the corner 182
came faintly through the closed 78
came faintly through the window 55
came galloping across the fields 40
came increasing swarms of public 40
came muffled through the closed 74
came quickly around the corner 40
came strolling around the corner 65
came swiftly around the corner 41
came together before the virgin 91
came whistling around the corner 40
case brought before the courts 224
case brought before the united 58
case defined earlier is called 61
case depending before the judges 236
case dragged through the courts 699
case finally reached the united 172
case reduces itself to simple 47
clear himself before the senate 58
clear pattern begins to emerge 53
clear picture begins to emerge 72
clear solution through the filter 54
cold bivouac without an effort 42
cold northern regions of europe 55
come barreling around the corner 44
come careening around the corner 43
come together across the street 55
coming muffled through the deadening 58

cabbage came whirling like a 59
carried into effect upon a 61
carried into public life a 43
carried these powers into a 48
carried what looked like a 620
censure once passed upon a 53
central bank should have a 132
certain young fellow whom i 46
classes wearing something like a 52
clutching what looked like a 158
collect their spirit into a 56
company from entering into a 105
company will always have a 79
concern over whether such a 73
convert their energy into a 55
convert their kingdoms into a 77
convert west berlin into a 55
country have always been a 56
country just emerging from a 185
country must always have a 75
country will always find a 43
country will always have a 78
country will seldom have a 122
crumble when rolled into a 127
crystal ball dropping into a 53

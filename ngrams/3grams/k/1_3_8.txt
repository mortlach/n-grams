k and evaluate 92
k and increases 244
k and multiply 220

k and otherwise 44
k and parallel 101
k and positive 111
k and produces 127
k and relative 45
k and specific 154
k and standard 176
k and subtract 43
k and therefore 1442
k and thickness 748
k and velocity 139
k and wavelength 103
k are adjacent 93
k are adjusted 43
k are assigned 195
k are attached 83
k are combined 104
k are commonly 90
k are compared 152
k are computed 440
k are constant 1851
k are directed 41
k are directly 129
k are discrete 56
k are distinct 212
k are elements 50
k are expected 53
k are functions 787
k are included 180
k are inserted 42
k are integers 1610
k are involved 46
k are mutually 542
k are negative 116
k are normally 46
k are observed 52
k are obtained 1312
k are occupied 103
k are parallel 579
k are positive 2023
k are possible 281
k are probably 45
k are produced 57
k are provided 94
k are referred 122
k are replaced 307
k are required 236
k are selected 221
k are somewhat 44
k are strictly 54
k are supposed 53
k are therefore 224
k are variables 117
k being constant 290
k being positive 121
k being replaced 49
k bit positions 136
k can therefore 239
k for constant 102
k for instance 111
k for selected 112
k gas constant 68
k has positive 46
k may therefore 175
k new variables 69
k now consider 40
k ohm resistor 544
k per molecule 128
k see appendix 556
k that contains 140
k that includes 60
k that minimize 99
k that produces 107
k thus obtained 165
k was actually 40
k was assigned 47
k was computed 180
k was constant 77
k was increased 164
k was intended 40
k was observed 170
k was obtained 585
k was possible 40
k was probably 44
k was replaced 52
k was selected 156
k was supposed 44
k was therefore 43
k with constant 71

z and consider 119
z and constant 106
z and distance 166
z and evaluating 44
z and indicate 41
z and multiply 46
z and negative 138
z and pressure 49
z and standard 195
z and subtract 48
z and therefore 768
z and velocity 218
z are assigned 173
z are cartesian 819
z are computed 213
z are constant 410
z are declared 96
z are directly 41
z are distinct 276
z are elements 137
z are employed 44
z are functions 737
z are included 126
z are integers 497
z are involved 44
z are mutually 228
z are negative 110
z are observed 58
z are obtained 907
z are obviously 45
z are parallel 231
z are positive 932
z are possible 54
z are referred 71
z are regarded 109
z are replaced 455
z are required 178
z are selected 58
z are stressed 159
z are supposed 40
z are therefore 152
z are variables 841
z being directed 52
z being parallel 58
z being positive 85
z being vertical 156
z can therefore 92
z for hydrogen 116
z for instance 55
z for positive 107
z for variables 92
z its distance 80
z may therefore 93
z that contains 51
z was computed 53
z was obtained 188
z with constant 43
z with positive 146
z with velocity 161
z zen buddhism 133

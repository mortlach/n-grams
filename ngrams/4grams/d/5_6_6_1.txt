daily rounds through a 56
dancing wildly around a 69
danger should induce a 110
dashing headlong through a 55
demon without entering a 57
devil always builds a 295
domed turret crowning a 67
doubt always remain a 45
doubt arises whether a 172
doubt exists whether a 224
doubt myself whether i 114
doubt occurs whether a 47
doubt passed through a 66
drain passes through a 41
drama arises through a 59
drawn slowly across a 40
drawn slowly through a 128
drawn through points a 604
drawn through points p 83
drawn upward through a 63
draws around itself a 44
dreaming dotard should i 53
dress myself without a 99
dress standing before a 126
dress standing beside a 101
drill passed through a 71
drink served before a 45
drink something before i 181
drive around without a 63
drive passes through a 105
drive slowly through a 89
drive toward becoming a 91
driving around without a 101
driving cattle through a 126
driving forces behind a 739
driving slowly through a 132
driving wheels through a 187
drove slowly through a 200
drown myself before i 60
dusky figure seemed a 121
dusts should become a 42

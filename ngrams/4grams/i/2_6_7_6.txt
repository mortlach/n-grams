it stands upright without 41
it stands written before 57
it struck against something 156
it struck sharply upward 42
it surely matters little 50
it sweeps everything before 167
it through avenues closed 52
it through college without 140
it through congress without 74
it through customs without 59
it through medical school 918
it through pleasant fields 53
it through several drafts 65
it through several layers 155
it through several stages 105
it turned against itself 56
it twenty minutes before 297
it unless america agrees 52
it unless congress itself 141
it unless senator morgan 44
it without anybody noticing 64
it without betraying emotion 45
it without blemish before 170
it without careful thought 56
it without express orders 42
it without extreme regret 120
it without material injury 42
it without obtaining larger 65
it without offending anyone 47
it without previous notice 90
it without similar effect 49
it without suffering injury 47
it without visible emotion 62
it worked smoothly enough 76

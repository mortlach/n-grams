lunch to prepare for 60
lunch we resumed our 62
lunch we started for 127
lunch we started off 181
lunch we started out 121
lured an heiress out 89
lures of pleasure and 119
lurking in corners and 111
lurking in forests and 68
lurks in silence and 92
lusts of avarice and 41
lymph is drained off 61
lyric in general and 85

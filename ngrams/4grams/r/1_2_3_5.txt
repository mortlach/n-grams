r at all times 52
r at any given 69
r at any point 313
r at each point 135
r at that point 88
r at this point 228
r by its value 61
r by this method 48
r do not appear 46
r do not change 157
r do not occur 42
r in all cases 129
r in both cases 65
r in real space 59
r in this region 113
r is any point 59
r is not empty 57
r is not equal 559
r is not fixed 46
r is not found 60
r is not given 121
r is not known 632
r is not large 235
r is not quite 114
r is not small 76
r is now given 104
r is put equal 126
r is set equal 469
r is that which 118
r is then equal 150
r is then found 42
r is then given 617
r is thus given 45

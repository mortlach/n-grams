the equation and any 66
the equation and are 463
the equation and ask 72
the equation and can 302
the equation and does 104
the equation and each 46
the equation and for 524
the equation and get 205
the equation and had 57
the equation and has 174
the equation and how 87
the equation and its 1050
the equation and let 339
the equation and may 232
the equation and not 322
the equation and one 267
the equation and our 83
the equation and put 104
the equation and say 103
the equation and see 265
the equation and set 86
the equation and that 2310
the equation and then 1925
the equation and they 104
the equation and this 590
the equation and thus 473
the equation and try 66
the equation and two 75
the equation and use 596

the equation and you 376
the equation are all 383
the equation are and 74
the equation are both 99
the equation are for 52
the equation are not 856
the equation are now 116
the equation are real 528
the equation are set 45
the equation are then 186
the equation are thus 45
the equation are two 57
the equation being all 43
the equation being that 62
the equation but can 46

the equation for thus 43
the equation for two 740
the equation for use 89
the equation for with 66
the equation for you 89
the equation had not 66
the equation has any 65
the equation has for 40

the equation may then 147
the equation now has 64
the equation now let 107
the equation one can 327
the equation one has 40
the equation one may 48
the equation set and 72
the equation set can 59
the equation set for 131
the equation set out 69
the equation that all 50

the equation this was 70
the equation this way 187
the equation thus for 62
the equation use this 51
the equation using this 191
the equation was not 614
the equation was put 46
the equation was run 60

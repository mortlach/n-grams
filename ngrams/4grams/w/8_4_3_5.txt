wrenched from its frame 41
wrenched from its grasp 65
wrenched from its hands 54
wrenched from its mooring 86
wrenched from its orbit 44
wrenched from its place 1003
wrenched from its roots 87
wrenched from its setting 50
wrenched from our grasp 60
wrenched from our hands 143
wrenched from them again 61
wrestled from his grasp 41
wrestled over its naked 62
wrestled sore and still 51
wretched baby was missing 41
wretched boys and girls 47
wretched bush was beset 220
wretched home and cruel 49
wretched huts and carts 51
wretched living and working 174
wretched wife and mother 86
wretched young man arose 62
wretches bold and blind 44
wriggled free and stood 48
wriggled from her grasp 61
wriggled from his grasp 147
wriggled into her dress 47
wrinkled face and hands 173
wrinkled face and small 55
wrinkled face and white 339
wrinkled face was white 53
wrinkled like old leather 107
wrinkled skin and sagging 42
wrinkled skin and white 41
wrinkles from her dress 200
wrinkles from her skirt 414
wrinkles have not tamed 46
wrinkles into his shirt 41
wrinkles reaping thee sweet 74

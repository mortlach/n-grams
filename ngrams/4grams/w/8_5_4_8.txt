wandered about till daylight 48
wandered about town questioning 103
wantonly mooting these questions 76
waterway might have sufficed 43
whatever about other emeralds 47
whatever basis best reflects 70
whatever costs were incurred 78
whatever could have happened 169
whatever crime these strangers 95
whatever funds were required 64
whatever gains were achieved 51
whatever might have befallen 166
whatever might have followed 45
whatever might have happened 1716
whatever might have occurred 208
whatever might have remained 116
whatever might have rendered 120
whatever others have promised 45
whatever risks were involved 212
whatever seems most suitable 47
whatever shall such property 82
whatever steps were possible 91
whatever steps were required 106
whatever suits their purposes 45
whatever tasks were assigned 109
whatever terms were dictated 56
whatever terms were possible 49
whatever would have happened 207
whatever would have occurred 63
wherever lands were assigned 73
wherever women were employed 42
wireless local loop services 51
wishbone where your backbone 65
withholding agent when presenting 128
wondered about such questions 53
wondered about these questions 93
wondered about what happened 105
workaday people have demanded 59
wretched people were regarded 56
wretched taste ever produced 57

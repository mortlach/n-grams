ye all night most 47
ye any tidings there 44
ye are again made 41
ye are built upon 144
ye are keeping your 72
ye are sealed unto 4931
ye are sprung from 46
ye are truly free 83
ye bear fruit like 40
ye both shall live 2352
ye can curse rome 54
ye can enter into 82
ye can never know 40
ye can never tell 49
ye can write your 48
ye had known what 2002
ye had never been 92
ye had rather heard 62
ye had taken from 213
ye lay aside your 75
ye lay bound upon 56
ye lying routing there 71
ye may build unto 119
ye may claim half 62
ye may enter into 45
ye may found upon 77
ye may guess what 141
ye may prove what 4983
ye may spare your 67
ye may thrust your 120
ye may waste much 216
ye not after their 216
ye not judge what 45
ye not rather take 1601
ye not smell harm 42
ye not truly poor 55
ye see heaven open 63
ye that boast your 54
ye that bonny road 100
ye that cleave unto 119
ye that drink wine 48
ye that enter here 452
ye that mourn over 51
ye that press your 91
ye that would have 87
ye was maybe best 61
ye who enter here 9091
ye who would fain 49
ye who would know 90
ye yet aware what 57

ya did appear above 50
yea and strong withal 123
ye are rapping again 71
ye are right about 89
ye are talking about 82
ye are thinking shame 54
yea two faces under 111
ye can never enter 53
ye had never known 120
ye had still hoped 379
ye see anything looking 57
ye that after shall 46
ye that braid braid 63
ye that small cloud 42
ye too shall dwell 49
ye who shake hills 45
ye who would enter 47

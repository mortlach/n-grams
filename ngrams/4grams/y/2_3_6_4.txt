yea and beyond their 99
ye all follow your 186
ye are already half 59
ye are become dull 61
ye are become rich 53
ye are called into 47
ye are called unto 136
ye are called upon 122
ye are elders among 65
ye are fallen away 92
ye are fallen from 1391
ye are neither very 84
ye are passed over 369
ye are standing here 47
ye are turned away 95
ye dear tender ties 100
ye did indeed take 46
ye had better take 105
ye had broken your 53
ye had fallen into 46
ye had forgot your 76
ye may abound unto 73
ye may always have 59
ye may attain unto 103
ye may attend upon 372
ye may become sons 266
ye may behold your 61
ye may depend upon 133
ye may expect many 40
ye may goodly make 99
ye may prolong your 363
ye may reckon sure 46
ye may scrape your 98
ye not driven away 43
ye now turned back 49
ye one another from 162
ye one another unto 84
ye say another word 54
ye see vanish meant 53
ye sow another reaps 191
ye who strain your 65
ye with silent lips 65
ye yon narrow road 52
yr are fairly rare 259
yr being fairly rare 135

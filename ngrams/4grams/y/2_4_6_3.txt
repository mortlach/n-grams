ye also become his 76
ye draw waters out 75
ye ever spoken thus 44
ye have always with 3872
ye have before you 57
ye have bitter zeal 50
ye have chosen for 54
ye have chosen you 351
ye have cursed them 52
ye have daubed with 159
ye have double too 84
ye have driven him 47
ye have fouled with 174
ye have learned and 80
ye have prayed for 183
ye have prayed that 269
ye have shewed for 81
ye have shewed this 50
ye have showed for 119
ye have showed them 63
ye have showed this 59
ye have sought for 86
ye have supped this 51
ye have tasted that 2575
ye have thought and 79
ye have thought that 111
ye have turned out 353
ye know better than 56
ye know yonder lad 61
ye left behind you 116
ye look taller and 61
ye love another man 42
ye love vanity and 96
ye make amends for 99
ye make answer for 65
ye much better than 337
ye must purvey you 70
ye play always with 58
ye ride faster and 44
ye were bought with 273
ye were raised with 99
ye were standing all 61
ye were taught that 133
ye were untrue and 40
ye will answer for 46
ye will repent and 76
ye will scarce ken 47
ye will shiver with 51

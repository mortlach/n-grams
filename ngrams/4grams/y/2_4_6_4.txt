ye also walked some 290
ye have already heard 69
ye have already hold 675
ye have already seen 74
ye have always been 87
ye have breathed rich 54
ye have broken your 51
ye have caused many 401
ye have glided away 44
ye have gotten into 56
ye have learned from 81
ye have lingered five 45
ye have looked upon 62
ye have neither heard 274
ye have obeyed from 1089
ye have passed away 44
ye have passed from 47
ye have played among 55
ye have rights over 124
ye have spoken come 340
ye have spoken here 53
ye have spoken into 133
ye have spoken truth 46
ye have spoken well 74
ye have turned away 45
ye have turned into 68
ye here before your 228
ye must always pray 57
ye weave another wears 74
ye were become very 76
ye were called into 201
ye were called unto 1500
ye were passed over 429
ye will always have 73
ye will hearken unto 614
ye will revolt more 451
ye will scarce have 86

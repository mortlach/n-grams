ye forge another bears 143
ye might become weary 78
ye might choose life 56
ye might suffer loss 50
ye raise scares upon 44
ye rapid floods give 59
ye saved through faith 6831

ye shall become like 127
ye shall hearken unto 179
ye shall measure from 152
ye shall perish among 213
ye shall prolong your 209
ye shall remove from 188
ye shall render unto 153
ye shall return unto 196
ye shall suffer these 49
ye shall surely find 176
ye shall surely know 110
ye would abound more 1083
ye would hearken unto 77

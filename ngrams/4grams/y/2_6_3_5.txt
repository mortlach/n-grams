ye astray and cause 80
ye behold that angels 64
ye chosen this place 278
ye houses and dwell 176
ye killed him while 52
ye killed this colin 85
ye little ken about 105
ye refuse and rebel 2763
ye saints and angels 45
ye should not stand 87
ye should now awake 98
ye sought that which 583
ye wholly bid adieu 87

ye cliffs and islands 428
ye fasted and mourned 360
ye groves and crystal 42
ye intend any cruelty 49
ye ladies that despise 64
ye mighty and despair 262
ye mighty and pompous 48
ye return and discern 255
ye should not worship 47
ye streams that smoothly 86
ye tender our pleasure 163
ye thought for raiment 4495
ye through his poverty 3220

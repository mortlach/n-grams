ye dangers were great 44
ye depart from your 66
ye desist from your 78
ye famous wise ones 207
ye forget your tears 219
ye neither know what 75
ye peoples from afar 69
ye should come there 46
ye should ever have 59
ye should have been 295
ye should have died 56
ye should have done 152
ye should have seen 360
ye should have sent 46
ye should have wept 66
ye should have your 72
ye should shew forth 1397
ye should show forth 1479
ye should take care 50
ye should take upon 78
ye should turn from 913
ye simple ones will 125
ye swerve from truth 42

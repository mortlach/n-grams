yanked open a desk 94
yanked open a door 152
yawned like a great 51
yawned like a gulf 94
yawned like a waking 155
yelled like a wild 134
yellow like a ripe 54
yellow over a blue 40
yellow upon a blue 93
yielding forth a breath 65
yielding only a bare 45
yielding only a single 117
yielding only a very 77
yields from a single 251
yields only a part 57
yields only a poor 150
yields only a single 1008
yields only a tiny 55
yields only a very 678
yields over a range 82
yields over a wide 217
yields such a high 94
yields such a lake 58
yogurt into a bowl 396
yonder from a great 69
yonder like a hoop 55
yonder like a rind 108
yonder moon i swear 126
younger days a great 68
younger days a very 78
younger days i have 207
younger days i heard 53
younger days i held 45
younger days i knew 66
younger days i once 40
younger days i used 377
younger many a time 40
younger ones a good 66
younger years i have 42
younger years i used 76

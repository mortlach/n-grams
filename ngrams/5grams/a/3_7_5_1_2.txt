all persons obeying a king 78
all unworthy though i be 62
and against which i am 157
and brought about a re 87
and company where i am 55
and heartily tired i am 47
and history which i am 40
and language which i am 41
and objects which i am 43
and perhaps while i am 68
and praises which i do 41
and precious tired i am 45
and robbers while i am 311
and thankful shall i be 62
and towards which i am 89
and unworthy though i be 43
and whisper while i am 54
and wondering where i am 132
and worship which i do 67
any liberty which i at 51
any promise which i am 72
are matters which i am 49
are wondering where i am 90

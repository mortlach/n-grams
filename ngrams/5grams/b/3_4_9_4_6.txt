bear their faculties more meekly 59
being fast developed into something 73
being most carefully made darker 57
big blue childlike eyes stared 45
bring great abilities into notice 60
bring into existence such lively 128
bring such amendment into effect 76
but also prescribing what clothes 48
but also volunteer some degree 74
but bearing certainly very little 42
but come naturally into spirit 55
but from somewhere deep inside 134
but made themselves felt almost 108
but many victories have taught 75
but most necessary wars without 46
but only foretells what should 52
but other observers have failed 65
but such artifices were thought 56
but such instances have always 42
but their followers were treated 139
but their influence will remain 100
but their opponents were forced 54
but were prevented from carrying 96
but were prevented from crossing 57
but were prevented from entering 222
but were prevented from further 87
but your sovereign will reward 41

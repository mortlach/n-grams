both were sacrificing their interest 61
but also empirical data supports 65
but even published their speeches 43
but have succeeded only partially 40
but keep themselves more concealed 59
but many instances have occurred 49

but their intrigues were rejected 121
but their operations were confined 54
but their overtures were rejected 59
but their proposals were rejected 91
but their sentences were commuted 257
but these conditions were declined 53
but these obstacles were overcome 79
but these proposals were rejected 123
but were prevented from completing 62
but were prevented from proceeding 111
but what resembles some sensation 47

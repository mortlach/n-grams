breath loud and short like 109
bred among our quiet crew 123
brim full and running over 150
bringing down his right hand 41
bringing peace and order into 69
brings from his house what 46
brings wealth and every other 103
burn what they shall miss 173
bury their dead under their 48
bury their dead within their 76
buying cheap and selling high 76
buying here and selling there 143

began a race against time 117
began a slow descent down 51
began a slow descent from 42
began a slow descent into 96
below a line extending from 95
beneath a most stately arch 57
board a ship returning from 72
books i have written have 81
breathe a word against such 87
build a case against your 61
build a more general theory 43
build a more perfect union 50
build a wall between their 41
built a great funeral pile 77
built a great funeral pyre 105
built a huge funeral pyre 50

banished from his native place 69
beautiful face and piercing hazel 82
beautiful gold and silver coins 70
beautiful tree that blooms white 93
believed there was little danger 44
believed there was little point 49
believed there was something about 42
believed there was something fatal 67
believed these things william blake 46
besieged were not without hopes 115
bestowed upon him singular marks 43
bestowed upon his chosen people 85
betrayed into this common error 54
bitterly cold and frosty morning 77
blissful halt was called under 49
borrowed from sir walter scott 88
breakfast laid and holmes pouring 57
breathless over that strange parting 54
brilliant blue and yellow guise 80
business there was little change 59

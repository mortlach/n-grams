cafe double from its little 44
came bounding from all points 89
came bursting into his office 46
came crashing down all around 85
came mainly from new england 97
came mostly from new england 83
came slowly from his canvas 88
came slowly into that circle 46
came storming into his office 65
came streaming down her cheeks 67
came streaming down his cheeks 62
came sweeping from them across 48
came tumbling over one another 155
camp neither well nor safely 65
cant hardly tell who anyone 45
cars crashing into one another 51
case evoked among his fellow 119
case something like this should 139
cash income from this source 127
cast adrift those that thought 45
cast ashore upon this island 139
cast myself into this figure 49
cats killed mice and snakes 92
cell cycles need two random 47
cent acetic acid and dilute 41
chin tucked into his collar 83
city broken down and without 129
clear enough from his writings 40
code figure your net profit 51
cold moment when they should 62
cold winter days and nights 188
come adrift from its moorings 40
come crashing down all around 55
come hurrying back with little 41
come tumbling over one another 65

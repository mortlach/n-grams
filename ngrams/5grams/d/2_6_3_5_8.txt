do better than older patients 63
do better than quote verbatim 135
do hereby and hereon solemnly 49
do something that really mattered 42
do something that would convince 41
do something that would displease 46
do something that would normally 51
do something that would otherwise 192
do something that would surprise 55
do something they would otherwise 111
do without this world faceless 110

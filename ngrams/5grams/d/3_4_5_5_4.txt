day from morning until past 43
day their music drove deep 51
day those words would have 45

did these words appear upon 42
did those whose tents were 44
did what others would have 44

doing over eight since nine 49
doing some thinking about what 118
dry wind which blows down 83
dry wind which blows from 115

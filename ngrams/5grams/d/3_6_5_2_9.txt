day nations could be dominated 48
dead moment which the magnetism 108
dear little piece of injustice 63
death itself shall be destroyed 72
did nations agree to surrender 50
did prince henry the navigator 121
did thereby strip the provinces 51
does hereby agree to indemnify 111
does indeed cause the necessary 65
does indeed imply the existence 52
does indeed imply the necessity 69
does indeed stand in connection 159
doing something about the conditions 44
doing something which is forbidden 54
dry sticks which he presently 43
dying seized thereof be domiciled 125

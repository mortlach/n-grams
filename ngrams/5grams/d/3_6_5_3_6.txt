day almost killing and wounding 74
day before writing this letter 55
day dawned sunny and bright 41
day glides after day through 114
day looked black and gloomy 50
dead empire still sat throned 40
dead kitten where his gloves 54
dead matter would not resist 224
deal better about this matter 73
deal better cause for regret 42
dear little child was choked 45
death itself shall not remain 79
death should close her career 54
death without issue his family 53
death without mercy and without 71
death without raising his little 60
did armies engage with greater 126
did further order and direct 59
did something finer and better 72
did something novel and striking 118
die fighting rather than submit 52
does follow habit and custom 48
does greater skill and energy 44
does hereby grant and convey 181
does hereby grant and release 1022
does hereby waive and release 163
does titania cross her oberon 101
doing damage after its escape 42
doing something above and beyond 112
doing something rather than merely 120
doing something right and praise 76
doth hereby grant and convey 177
doth hereby grant and release 183
doth hereby order and direct 55
dry rushes which ran through 46
dry sticks which had seemed 175

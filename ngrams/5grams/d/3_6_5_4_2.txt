day already shone upon the 65
day always comes when the 41
day before sitting down to 50
day christ arose from the 48
day clearly dawning when the 51
day periods could have as 168
day someone would come to 62
day someone would have to 48
day toward heaven from the 109
day walked about among the 60
dead animal moves only as 59
dead bodies shall fall in 128
dead bodies thrown into the 255
dead bodies thrown over the 99
dead person comes back to 48
dead person speaking from the 45
deal talked about just at 40
dear william would soon be 128
death itself shall part us 45
death should occur during the 87
death through every vein of 59
death through sheer lack of 47
death without issue during the 52
did england offer wrong to 90
did indeed arise from the 53
did indeed enter into the 49
did indeed exist among the 60
did indeed occur during the 99
did indeed spend much of 49
did indeed trade over the 42
did something which made the 42
die without issue during the 114
die without issue living at 539
die without issue male of 176
die without knowing what it 271
dim yellow light from the 81
does anyone really want to 116
does common sense tell us 71
does hereby grant unto the 72
does indeed arise from the 79
does indeed enter into the 43
does indeed sound like the 40
does profit enter into the 94
does thereby cause hurt to 91
does william fourth have to 70
dog should again lift up 52
doing almost every kind of 53
doing simple tasks such as 69
doing something about what he 42
doing something about what is 46
doing something about what we 52
doing something which leads to 155
doing something which will be 113
doth always either find or 44
doth hereby grant unto the 559
doth remain either bread or 84
dry places where there is 47
dry summer months when the 58
due before closing lime on 54
due before closing time on 336
due course gives birth to 41
due course taken over by 50
due course takes free of 401
due course would have to 51
dying nobody knows when or 56
dying without issue living at 307

day except sundays and legal 172
dead bodies covered with blood 54
dear brother expired this morning 48
death wishes against her mother 168
death wishes against his father 409
did neither propose nor agree 60
did plants acquire this power 90
did without everything that human 44
does hereby promise and agree 81
does indeed explain his deeds 43
does nature prepare our hearts 92
doing something because one wants 42
doing something illegal and getting 40
doth hereby promise and agree 445
doth neither slumber nor sleep 413
dying clouds contend with growing 353

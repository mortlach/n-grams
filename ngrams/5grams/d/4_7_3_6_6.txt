dark shadows and bright lights 67
data storage and access methods 44
deep ravines and creeks emptying 86
done against foes without number 55
door handles and window cranks 133
door quietly but firmly behind 52
door slammed and locked behind 59
down between two normal faults 51
down bronzed and rugged cheeks 46
down everything that exalts itself 124
during harvest and planting seasons 41
during marriage each spouse should 51
during mitotic and meiotic cycles 57
during question and answer periods 45

dancing a hornpipe upon the 67
danger i scarcely felt the 75
digging a circular hole in 41
doubt a survival from the 47
drawing a definite line of 66
drawing a distinct line of 79
drawing a parallel from the 69
drawing a response from the 73
drawing a straight line as 115
drawing a straight line at 73
drawing a straight line by 49
drawing a straight line in 149
drawing a straight line is 46
drawing a straight line of 108
drawing a straight line on 347
drawing a straight line or 97
drawing a straight line to 211
drawing a vertical line at 258
drawing a vertical line in 93
drawing a vertical line on 150
drawing a vertical line to 107
drawing a vertical line up 120
drawn a distinct line of 46
drawn a straight line to 45
draws a distinct line of 102
draws a parallel from the 47
draws a straight line in 54
draws a straight line on 137
draws a straight line to 108
draws a vertical line in 53
draws a vertical line on 121
dreading a defection from the 80
drill a vertical well to 59
drive a mosquito from my 63
driving a splendid pair of 103
driving a whispering wall of 42

durst not open to her 69
durst not show my head 51
durst not speak to her 80
durst not speak to him 226
durst not stay in her 46
durst not stay to see 363
durst not think of going 55
durst sit there in that 68
dusky and oily sea that 53
dusty for lack of being 60
dusty for lack of use 41
dwell and rule in you 42
dwell and walk in them 43
dwell any more on this 44
dwell for ever in god 103
dwell for ever in his 212
dwell for ever in our 46
dwell for ever in that 106
dwell for ever in this 46
dwell for ever on one 63
dwell for ever on this 55
dwell for ever the kings 85
dwell not only on her 41
dwell too much on her 80
dwell too much on his 140
dwell too much on one 167
dwell too much on our 96
dwell too much on that 455
dwell too much on them 50
dwell too much on this 594
dwelt too much on his 70
dwelt too much on this 60
dwelt two years in his 72

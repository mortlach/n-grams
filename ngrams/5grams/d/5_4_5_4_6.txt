defeat many times their number 46
dense life within made itself 80
depths into which their pastor 79
deter other firms from entering 94
devil only knows what choice 90
doors have never been closed 59

drama their parts were played 40
drawn from every fact before 81
drawn from thence were wasted 44
dreaming their dreams more clearly 46
dreams spun about like drowning 43
drive their whole host twenty 53
drops from which were closer 56
drunk from every such vessel 68
dusty road winding along through 49

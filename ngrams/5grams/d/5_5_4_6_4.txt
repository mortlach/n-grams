danger could have scared lost 92
danger shall have passed away 51
danger which must accrue from 44
danger which must result from 55
deadly peril from friday till 58
debts which have already been 54
decks would have fallen into 51
delay takes away something from 125
delve still more deeply into 55
deter others from entering into 98
deter people from entering into 56
deuce could have thought aunt 64
dimming light into yellow murk 41
doles which rich genius flings 66
dozen people were already there 41
dreams which were stirring among 71
drive thence some choice oxen 42
drops thereof have already laid 85
drove every other thought from 298
drugs which have already been 94

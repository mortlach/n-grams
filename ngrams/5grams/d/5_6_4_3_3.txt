daily common life does that 105
daily deluge over them does 98
daily thrills upon our ears 49
daily whether these things are 47
dancing through life with you 61
darling little babe that had 47
dashing through thick and thin 85
dates further back than that 47
dates without paying for them 71
debts beyond what they may 118
defer income from one year 86
delay marrying till they can 73
delve deeply into any one 41
denying scheme cost him one 51
depths lurked their red foes 59
devil should have his due 89
doubt little more easy than 75
doubt whether life had any 94
doubt whether more than one 337
doubt whether more than two 134
doubt whether there are any 2210
doubt whether there are not 426
doubt whether there are now 81
doubt whether there are ten 42
doubt whether there are two 138
doubt whether there hath not 117
doubt whether there may not 348
doubt whether there was any 3426
doubt whether there was not 272
doubt whether there was one 294
doubt whether these things are 48
doubt whether those who are 141
dozen blocks from his own 169
dozen german boys than one 79
drank deeply from his cup 75
drank deeply from his mug 49
drawing something from them for 125
drawn freely from his own 68
drawn mainly from his own 59
drawn mostly from his own 57
drawn partly from his own 54
drawn through life with his 63
draws heavily upon his own 52
draws strength from its own 46
dreams arises among you and 58
dreams divine lift his long 83
dress caught fire and she 118
dress clothes laid out and 49
dress draped over her arm 153
dress draped over one arm 41
dress myself from one end 46
drift through dark and day 209
drink without having his cab 44
drive around town and see 118
drove through town and out 155
drunk driver when she was 55
drunk poison what deaf and 124
dungeon better even than his 42
dusting pollen over her man 86

each city family should own 49
each having higher claims than 43
each having mutual duties and 46
each month passes without any 70
each other almost before they 85
each other better before they 80
each other homely taunts they 40
each other through prayer and 42
each other without altering men 45
each other without realizing that 144
each other without regard for 170
each other without touching and 45
each side should retain its 46
each side twenty cubits long 40
each such family member who 45
each towing barges loaded with 47
each waft gently lifted and 51
earth ball slowly surely and 75
earth keep silent before him 45
ego from various organs and 72
eye upon something before him 41
eye what stands before him 71

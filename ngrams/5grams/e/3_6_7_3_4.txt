each honest burgher who says 46
each member present and voting 97
each memory location can hold 46
each person against his name 140
each singular essence not only 136

earn higher incomes than those 142
earn higher profits than those 44

eating desert rodents and ants 150
egg whites stiffly and fold 124
end without incurring any debt 83

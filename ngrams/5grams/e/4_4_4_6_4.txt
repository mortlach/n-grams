early days were looked upon 45
early life have stolen into 64
early years were passed amid 44
eaten fall fell fallen feed 447
eaten fall fell fallen feel 244
eaten fall fell fallen find 77
eaten fall fell fallen flee 56
eaten fall fell fallen give 51
else have been little more 63
else have been ravaging your 73
even among these groups there 52
even during those periods when 309
even from their native land 49
even from their tender years 44
even from these sounds when 40
even from your friend miss 57
even glad when winter came 54
even have their bodies clean 45
even know what marble means 59
even know your middle name 66
even make your person more 127
even seen their images there 60
even their most deeply held 105
even these were broken into 86
even these were looked upon 95
even those most remote from 175
even those were almost worn 80
even threw their weight into 56
even when such actions were 67
even when their actions were 139
even when their bodies were 96
even when their fathers were 56
even when their forces were 47
even when their mothers were 80
even when their tongues were 46
even when these differ from 95
even when these latter were 65
even when those troops were 110
even your best friend will 176
even your very bowels will 48
ever come here another time 52
ever fell from mortal lips 140
ever from their native land 81
ever have been called from 89
ever have been called into 181
ever have been called upon 122
ever have been parted from 43
ever have been thought more 40
ever have such another fact 56
ever having been called upon 108
ever heard from mortal lips 102
ever heard such another word 86
ever held great empire over 59
ever knew when sunday came 107
ever left their native land 47
ever shed more bitter tears 59
evil days have fallen upon 49
evil doings from before mine 43
evil have their common root 54
eyes have been opened wide 98
eyes have been turned away 91
eyes have been washed clear 54
eyes have ever looked upon 290
eyes have ever rested upon 56
eyes like blue violets when 48
eyes lost their glazed look 89
eyes must have looked like 87
eyes must have opened wide 56
eyes must have rested upon 52
eyes only were dropping tears 78
eyes were cast eagerly upon 53
eyes were like vaults full 42
eyes were only inches away 61
eyes were only inches from 149
eyes were saying something else 118

full chorus join the song 46
full circle back to her 70
full circle back to his 172
full circle back to its 198
full circle back to our 155
full circle back to that 84
full eighty years of age 47
full gallop along the dry 46
full gallop into the area 58
full intent back to our 74
full oceanic tide of new 62
full strength from the old 114
full strength into the cup 418
full strength into the war 56
full twelve years of age 99

full weight down on her 47
full weight into the war 77

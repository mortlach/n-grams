fallen from princes have given 118
fallen into company from which 45
fallen like lightning from heaven 111
feathery fire whistling their whims 54
fierce bent against their faces 221
fighting their battles over again 333
filled their bellies like indian 71
flabby mouth uttered single words 50
follow their parents soon after 52
forces were brought into action 122
forces were ordered into action 40
formed their opinions were false 49
fought their battles over again 357
fronts nine thousand feet above 68
further step implies more power 47

familiar i was with the 56
fancied i was going to 221
fancies i had had of 53
fashioning a new set of 47
fathered a son out of 84
features i can see my 41
fiddled a bit with the 94
figured a way out of 241
figured i was going to 2543
figured i was not the 45
figured i was one of 91
figured i was out of 65
finally i did get my 74
finally i got fed up 65
finally i got her to 63
finally i got him to 119
finally i got out of 78
finally i got rid of 95
finally i ran out of 55
finally i saw that it 49
finally i was going to 121
finally i was put in 47
flights a day out of 71
florins a year for the 416
following a lead set by 82
following a long day at 46
following a long day of 105
following a man who is 42
following a new set of 70
following a path that is 256
following a row with the 56
follows a law that is 56
follows a long gap in 47
follows a path that is 379
follows a way that is 58
follows i mean for the 66
foolish i was not to 202
foresaw a new age of 43
foresaw a new era of 110
forgive a man for the 79
forgive a man who is 41
fortune i was going to 43
forward a law for the 106
forward a long way in 47
forward a new idea in 102
forward a new set of 248
forward a new way of 89
forward a plea for the 220
founded a new era in 133
founded a new era of 54
founded a new one at 67
founded a new one in 56
fragile a sex than in 51
frankly i can not do 59
friends i had met at 80
friends i had met in 149
friends i was going to 366
fumbled a bit with the 88
function f can not be 105
furnish a key for the 209
furnish a man for the 184
furnish a man with the 57
furnish a meal for the 72
furnish a new set of 256
furnish a path for the 84
furnish a poem for my 56
furnish a way out of 66

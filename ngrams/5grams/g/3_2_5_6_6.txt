gap of every vacant moment 110
gas is first passed through 274
get my point across without 45
get the point across without 149
get the right answer without 95
god or demon without entering 45
going on shore amongst heathens 91
going to scream bloody murder 128
going to sleep before eleven 42
going to sleep seemed almost 44
going to spend another minute 208
going to spend another winter 45
going to touch pretty deeply 79
going to waste another minute 168
going to waste another moment 48
going to write another letter 104
got my first speeding ticket 43
got the truck turned around 85
got to throwing stones through 112
got to write another letter 43

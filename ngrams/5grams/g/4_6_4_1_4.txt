gave something like a jump 53
gave something like a sigh 60
girl looked like a diana 85
girl should have a good 48
girl writes like a good 48
give myself what i need 58
give someone else a break 157
give someone else a turn 223
give something like a fair 58
give something like a true 41
glad enough when i heard 79

gone through what i have 694
gone through what i went 110
gone without saying a word 105

good fellow whom i knew 42
good friend when i tell 48
good grades means a great 50
good hunter whom i once 40
good should form a holy 43
good watering once a week 61
great blessing were a fire 52
great height into a deep 49
great market once a week 48

great relief when a canoe 62
great relief when i heard 53
great rivers form a great 126
great window were a kind 96

gentle gales retired and left 47
gentle smile crossed his face 43
gentle smile touched his lips 58

grants which congress may make 65
grassy acres specked with deer 50
greater risks towards its goal 44
greater social justice and more 119
greatly blaming herself for having 41
ground still covered with snow 44
groups whose members are more 149
groups whose members had been 69
groups whose members may have 52
groups whose support they need 44
groups within society that have 43
groups working against each other 42

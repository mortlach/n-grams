he in pieces shivered fair 44
he is almost entirely free 44
he is almost entirely self 41
he is always degraded from 53
he is always stealthily ready 67
he is called socrates smith 66
he is hereby exempted from 48
he is hereby expelled from 65
he is hereby relieved from 75
he is lately returned from 42
he is merely describing what 46
he is rudely awakened from 54
he is thereby absolved from 89
he is thereby debarred from 46
he so clearly betrayed from 51
he so freely bestowed upon 162
he so justly deserves from 54
he so lately expelled from 76

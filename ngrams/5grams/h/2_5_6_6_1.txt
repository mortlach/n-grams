he could always become a 53
he could always drowse a 91
he could always obtain a 71
he could always secure a 57
he could barely manage a 94
he could decide whether a 47
he could hardly afford a 67
he could hardly escape a 41
he could hardly expect a 216
he could hardly finish a 43
he could hardly obtain a 51
he could hardly refuse a 124
he could manage without a 69
he could neither become a 51
he might salute philip v 44
he never passed through a 74
he spoke english without a 49
he takes refuge behind a 46
he would always choose a 64
he would always prefer a 62
he would always remain a 505
he would always retain a 78
he would gladly accept a 116
he would gladly become a 75
he would indeed become a 79
he would likely become a 44
he would remain without a 41
he would resign unless a 49
he would simply become a 58
he would simply remain a 65
he would submit without a 60
he would surely become a 119
he would thereby become a 98

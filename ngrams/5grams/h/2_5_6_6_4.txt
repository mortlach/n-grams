he again turned toward those 48
he could almost always find 62
he could always depend upon 224
he could always escape from 55
he could bestow praise upon 59
he could devote little time 56
he could expect little from 165
he could expect little help 280
he could expect little more 117
he could hardly accede fast 51
he could hardly escape from 43
he could hardly realize such 60
he could mention without some 112
he could obtain canada from 62
he could obtain release from 44
he could obtain relief only 90
he could safely corner gold 51
he could safely depend upon 42
he could strike another blow 64
he could strike terror into 84
he could thereby effect their 40
he could travel better among 46
he durst fairly assign even 45
he found another letter from 82
he found indeed another love 67
he lived another twenty years 243
he might always depend upon 112
he might always reckon upon 58
he might betray christ unto 56
he might hourly expect from 43
he might indeed escape from 47
he might justly expect from 62
he might listen without hurt 81
he might repose awhile from 83
he might safely affirm what 43
he might safely depend upon 42
he might safely enough have 57
he might safely reckon upon 95
he might strike terror into 88
he might thereby strike more 45
he might without hazard have 75
he moved another frozen pace 58
he never caught another hare 45
he never needed repose more 43
he never played another game 52
he never showed without making 95
he never struck another blow 69
he never tasted animal food 64
he never tempts anyone else 45
he never turned anyone away 87
he never wanted strength when 58
he rather seemed pleased when 47
he rides through gloomy deep 52
he saved sister millie from 56
he seems solely intent upon 56
he spent almost twenty years 95
he spoke english fairly well 121
he spoke english pretty well 93
he would almost always find 40
he would almost sooner have 50
he would almost surely have 269
he would always insist upon 79
he would always oppose their 53
he would always return home 47
he would always wonder what 55
he would detach troops from 45
he would gladly escape your 41
he would hardly afford good 53
he would hardly thereby feel 64
he would prefer something else 108
he would prefer something more 87
he would return without fail 57
he would secure better ones 81
he would strike terror into 78
he would surely wander back 42

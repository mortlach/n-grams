he built another little church 73
he built another palace before 40
he could handle stalin better 41
he could listen without emotion 40
he could muster enough strength 71
he could muster strength enough 50
he could simply answer without 61
he could summon enough strength 45
he found slinking mutely amongst 48
he learns english without master 193
he never sought public office 281
he never thought without horror 164
he never walked abroad without 40
he thinks proper without injury 394
he would almost surely choose 52
he would retire behind something 52

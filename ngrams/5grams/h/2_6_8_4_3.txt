he almost excludes those things 76
he always believed there was 41
he always hastened when his 41
he always insisted upon being 50
he always regarded their death 79
he always remained calm and 45
he always returned from his 95
he always returned home with 54
he always wriggled past and 50
he avoids directly naming his 42
he became detached from his 56
he became eighteen years old 58
he became estranged from his 345
he became furiously angry and 45
he became furiously angry with 49
he became isolated from his 42
he became obedient unto death 1033
he became violently angry and 51
he fairly launched into him 47
he firmly believed there was 104
he further declared unto them 44
he greatly improves upon them 112
he looked anxiously into her 51
he looked directly into her 825
he looked directly into his 103
he looked earnestly into her 89
he looked fearfully over his 45
he looked intently into her 101
he looked searchingly into her 103
he looked sideways here and 116
he looked straight ahead and 269
he looked straight ahead with 69
he looked straight into her 838
he looked straight into his 161
he neither flinched from his 106
he passed sentence upon her 41
he passed therefrom into that 73
he plunged directly into his 59
he plunged straight into his 66
he readily received from his 73
he relied entirely upon his 85
he relies entirely upon his 69
he rushed furiously upon him 77
he seemed estranged from his 53
he seemed scarcely more than 87
he seldom received more than 46
he should alienate those who 150
he should approach from that 40
he should consider bringing any 47
he should consider those who 95
he should consider what they 121
he should contrive some way 48
he should foreknow such things 55
he should hereafter know who 93
he should probably even now 46
he should separate from her 43
he should separate from his 149
he should suddenly learn how 55
he should suddenly take her 64
he should thereafter learn that 108
he smiled joyously when that 55
he solely depended upon his 46
he stands pictured among his 98
he stared directly ahead and 66
he stared directly into her 104
he stared intently into her 102
he stared straight ahead and 181
he stared straight ahead for 42
he stared straight ahead with 61
he stared straight into her 107
he stared straight into his 40
he sweeps serenely over god 86
he thought abundant time had 74
he thought everyone else was 98
he thought hercules much too 62
he traced historic truth with 50
he turned abruptly away and 250
he turned abruptly from her 76
he turned abruptly from his 77
he turned eighteen years old 56
he turned fiercely upon him 63
he turned fiercely upon his 51
he turned furiously upon her 48
he turned suddenly upon his 98
he verily believed there was 43
he walked promptly into all 42
he walked sideways like this 49
he walked straight into his 63
he walked straight past her 122
he wholly departed from all 63
he writes directly from them 43

he appeared that august afternoon 47
he avoided any direct reference 46
he avoided any mental reference 52
he becomes one without aristotle 72
he forbore all farther addresses 81
he founded and became president 654
he founded his famous monastery 72
he himself but barely tolerated 50
he himself had almost forgotten 158
he himself had already exhausted 76
he himself had become convinced 110
he himself had fallen prostrate 61
he himself had further developed 126
he himself had helped establish 42
he himself was deeply concerned 145
he himself was firmly convinced 160
he himself was spending profusely 51
he ordered his guards instantly 47
he pursued his various avocations 43
he rallied his broken battalions 181
he rallied his broken squadrons 172
he regards with kindly tolerance 58
he repeated his earlier arguments 47
he repeated his earlier statement 58
he repeated his former assertions 47
he repeated his former expression 44
he repeated with another intonation 62
he resumed his former occupation 182
he stopped all further discussion 60
he stopped and looked carefully 55
he surveys his former employers 57
he trimmed his course accordingly 77
he unifies his sexual instincts 71

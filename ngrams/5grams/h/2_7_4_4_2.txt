he wheeled away from the 86
he wheeled back into the 42
he whirled away from the 81
he willingly took part in 41
he withdrew from rome to 46
he withdrew from there in 146
he withdrew from what he 47
he withdrew once more to 77
he wonders what kind of 98
he wonders what sort of 49
he wonders what there is 44
he wrought hard when he 43
he wrought much evil in 137
he wrought such feats of 61
he yielded once more to 43
he yielded only when he 41
hing together like bats in 87

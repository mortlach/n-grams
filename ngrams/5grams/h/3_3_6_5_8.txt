had all shaken hands cordially 90
had his little local personal 103
had not become fully conscious 53
had not become prime minister 290
had not thought about children 62
had now become prime minister 190
had now become quite numerous 40
had that strange dreamy weariness 62
had too little human interest 46
has had annual gross receipts 75
has his dreaded ghost anxiously 47
has not become fully conscious 54
has not caused major problems 45
has now become nearly obsolete 53
has this pretty greek youngster 64

heat and simmer until thickened 311

his own person which subverts 72
his see without first expressing 47
his way through every obstacle 218
how can finite grasp infinity 146
how they efface whole villages 52
hung with little white curtains 70

his knees suddenly gave way 51
his large mahogany desk and 68
his legal advisers told him 49
his legal services from one 202
his longer pastoral poems for 86

his rival followed only two 59
his roman education kept him 48
his round freckled face and 89
his royal authority over his 42
his royal highness drew near 41
his royal highness during his 66
his royal highness from his 91
his royal highness only for 74
his royal highness sent for 40
his royal highness told him 62
his royal highness will not 267
his royal presence from his 132
his royal revenues upon his 67
his ships depended upon his 88
his short attention span and 118
his sleep departed from him 78
his sleep departed from his 44
his sober judgment told him 100
his social contacts were with 47
his social identity have led 60
his social security card and 165
his strong religious faith and 51
his sword fiercely among his 42
his tawny scorched face and 188
his tepid beverage cool with 45
his tongue entirely during his 42
his tongue protruding from his 261
his troop withdrawing from him 43
his usual cheerful self and 42
his usual practice upon each 67
his voice remained calm and 100
his voice scarcely more than 76
his voice singularly rich and 40
his voice suddenly cold and 46
his voice suddenly hard and 46
his voice suddenly soft and 77
his wages depended upon his 61
his whole attention upon his 96
his whole attention upon that 49
his whole authority upon his 68
his whole doctrine upon this 62
his whole energies into his 62
his whole energies were now 51
his whole military life with 61
his whole religious sect and 54
his worthy helpmeet were not 41
his writing utensils from his 60
hot water cascaded over her 43

how people actually live and 157
how people actually speak and 44
how people actually think and 103
how people actually think was 46
how people evaluate their own 52
how people perceive their own 135

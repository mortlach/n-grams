hands there float more artful 44
hands three times during dinner 103
hands were still tied behind 859
happy dream stand there before 40
heaven ever shine more clearly 42
heaven have piled their stores 50
heaven were never much thicker 79
heaven when springing buds unfold 47
heirs took place very slowly 54
heroes well armed into battle 68
horns hanging about their trunks 67
horse upon eight feet instead 40
hours during which your station 64
hours more would have placed 52
human beings could live without 44
human beings would have become 47
human body could have reached 93
human body would fall heavily 98
human dust takes upon itself 44
human foot could tread without 55
human mind under very singular 142
human pity shall fall silent 43
human race might have become 43
human race would have become 237
human race would soon become 52

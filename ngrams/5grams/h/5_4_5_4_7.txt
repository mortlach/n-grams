hands were feasting upon roasted 78
hands were first tied together 46
hands were still tied together 43
hands were thrust into pockets 47
hands were twice their natural 44
happy days after their marriage 46
hearts have grown very strongly 107
heaved their foamy tops against 110
heaven only knows what besides 51
holding their tails like whipped 116
hopes have never been realized 47
hopes upon forcing their opinions 40
horse were drawn down towards 44
horse will start upon tuesday 98
hosts moving under other banners 49
hours more would have brought 46
hours more would have enabled 45
human beings apart from animals 98
human beings avert their thoughts 79
human beings could live together 136
human beings under their control 42
human heart which give courage 61
human mind might have crusted 258
human mind might have gathered 76

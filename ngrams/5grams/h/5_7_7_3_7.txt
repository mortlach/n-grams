hands against freedom and science 54
hands clasped tighter and tighter 89
hands pressed against her forehead 53
hands pressed against her stomach 84
hands pressed against her temples 145
hands pressed against his forehead 55
hands pressed against his stomach 116
hands pressed against his temples 96
hands several arduous and several 46
holding together parents and offspring 45
honor forever sullied and brought 56
hours between rapture and anxiety 86
house between newport and cardiff 68
house between slavery and freedom 49
hunger demanding renewal but surfeit 62

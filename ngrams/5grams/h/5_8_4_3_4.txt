hands suddenly from his face 52
hands traveled down her back 100
hands traveled over her body 44
hands trembled more and more 125
hands trembled more than ever 47
hands wandered over her body 76
hated nicholas from that hour 41
healthy distance from each other 42
helping children cope with their 97
helping patients cope with their 144
helping students cope with their 50
honor devolves upon you also 293
hosts shrouded from each other 70
hours discussing ways and means 50
hours snatched here and there 91
house insisted upon his having 40
human evolution there has been 165
human relations have not been 40
human relations were not only 40
human subjects have not been 93
humor vanished from his face 48
hungry children crying for their 84

hailed a cab back to 145
hailed a cab from the 79
halted a few days at 286
halted a few days in 72
halted a few days to 178
halted a few feet in 62
handed a long list of 48
handed i can move the 53
handed i got clear of 96
handle a new kind of 59
handle a new type of 57
handle a peak load of 44
hardly a day during the 97
hardly a day went by 1586
hardly a day when he 171
hardly a day when the 218
hardly a day when we 89
hardly a long face to 107
hardly a man among the 121
hardly a man among us 105
hardly a new theme in 52
hardly a year went by 465
hardly a year when he 43
hazard i had been in 323
height i was able to 65
helped a lot during the 41
helped a lot when we 40
herald a new dawn in 52
herald a new dawn of 71
herald a new form of 155
herald a new kind of 193
herald a new type of 54
herald a new wave of 79
hinder a man from the 166
hooked a leg over the 214
horror i had upon my 123
horses i had seen in 98
houses i had seen in 381
hummed a few bars of 1400
hunted a long time in 49

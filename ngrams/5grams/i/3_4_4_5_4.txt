icy wind slow rolls away 53
idea took some getting used 59
idea what their names were 45
idea what these people were 67
idea what these words meant 56
idea what those words meant 87
idea will ever enter their 79
its aching heart beneath their 58
its beams were mingled half 138
its bearing upon human life 118
its bearing upon social life 73
its coming into force have 140
its cost many times over 995
its form must appear just 52
its great tail spread open 46
its having been acted upon 53
its having been based upon 54
its having been blown from 52
its having been built upon 48
its having been first made 50
its having been first used 70
its having been fixed upon 41
its having been found there 40
its having been taken away 58
its having been taken from 210
its having been taken into 68
its having been taken over 91
its heart rate slows down 41
its lame legs would take 47
its life from every other 46
its lips were drawn back 75
its main axis running from 62
its next term after such 63
its rays more fully upon 165
its skin four times during 43
its truth even within those 49
its very last hours were 67
its warm breath gushing forth 70
its warm breath stealing over 197
its worth many times over 384

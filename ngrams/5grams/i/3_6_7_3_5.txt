ill planet crossed his prime 46
ill standing upright with hunger 67
its border dispute with china 105
its chords tremble with sweet 105
its flames crackling and glaring 51
its fossil remains are found 56
its launch vehicle and parts 225
its little trimmings and facings 42
its lobbying efforts with state 46
its mystic shimmer was casting 76
its narrow streets and lofty 40
its narrow streets and small 85
its narrow streets are lined 45
its narrow streets his glory 48
its nature offends our sense 79
its powers between two people 147
its pretty hamlets all vivid 121
its regions studded with towns 59
its remote effects may often 48
its silent example and gives 83
its solemn promise but would 57
its special features and makes 44
its speech resides its whole 59
its sturdy justice and plain 101
its tapering lantern and oriel 41
its various aspects and bearings 68
its various degrees and forms 40
its waters colored with blood 110
its wooden pillars and tiled 55

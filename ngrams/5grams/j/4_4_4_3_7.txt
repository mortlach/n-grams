jack will fill our bellies 48
jars have been oft appeased 47
jest like their own goblins 41
join also unto our enemies 555
joys when sins are covered 117
jump over their own shadows 136
jury from giving any verdict 303
jury took only ten minutes 67
jury trial only with respect 132
jury will have two retarding 54
just back from his travels 60
just back from his vacation 48
just been said with respect 64
just bend down and comfort 59
just come from his bedside 48
just come from his travels 247
just come from that country 51
just fall down and worship 133
just hate when that happens 99
just heard from her husband 42
just heard what was happening 74
just laid down that buckler 44
just laid there and watched 45
just left home for college 55
just like your not believing 57
just make sure that everything 85
just making sure that everything 79
just means vowing and promising 66
just over when they arrived 65
just saying these things because 56
just sits back and watches 186
just sits there and listens 98
just sits there and watches 218
just stay like this forever 48
just talk like that because 46
just walk away and pretend 83
just went ahead and started 58
just went along with everything 82
just your name and address 160

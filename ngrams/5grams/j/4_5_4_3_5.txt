jack again from its niche 91
jigs after their own dreary 65
join issue upon this point 52
join sitting bull and crazy 73
jury could make but which 43
just about more than anything 50
just about ready for anything 44
just about sick and tired 103
just about time for lunch 62
just about what one might 109
just about what one would 296
just about what they would 86
just about what you might 56
just about what you would 282
just after dark one evening 56
just after dark one gusty 684
just after dawn one morning 44
just after dawn this morning 123
just after seeing his father 64
just broke down and cried 790
just getting along with people 49
just getting from one place 95
just issuing from his house 65
just keeping your head above 40
just march into that setting 65
just merging into her teens 84
just might work out after 51
just moved from one place 73
just moved into our first 79
just moved into our house 75
just moved into this house 142
just never know who might 70
just never made any sense 48
just plain sick and tired 231
just putting forth its leaves 41
just risen from bed ought 64
just risen from her chair 103
just risen from her knees 130
just risen from his chair 84
just risen from his knees 102
just risen from its ashes 76
just risen from its bosom 51
just sinking into his grave 72
just sitting back and letting 202
just sitting back and waiting 226
just sitting down and talking 263
just sitting down and thinking 95
just sitting down and waiting 61
just sitting down and writing 285
just sitting here and talking 61
just sitting here and waiting 72
just sitting there and letting 75
just sitting there and looking 165
just sitting there and staring 83
just sitting there and talking 51
just sitting there and thinking 144
just sitting there and waiting 317
just stand back and watch 968
just stand here all night 62
just stand here and stare 47
just stand here and watch 732
just stand there all night 45
just stand there and allow 47
just stand there and laugh 194
just stand there and scream 48
just stand there and shake 40
just stand there and smile 154
just stand there and stare 881
just stand there and watch 2584
just stand there for hours 41
just stick your head under 44
just stood there and could 85
just stood there and cried 368
just stood there and gaped 98
just stood there and gazed 68
just stood there and never 43
just stood there and shook 206
just stood there and tried 72
just stood there and would 56
just stood there for about 131
just stood there not knowing 224
just swept along his decks 50
just taken over his father 114
just terms from any state 815
just touch upon that vexed 90
just wants peace and quiet 41
just wasting time and money 91

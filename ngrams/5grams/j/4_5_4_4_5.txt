just about three years after 60
just above high tide level 105
just after half past eight 58
just after half past seven 65
just after having bade adieu 76
just after their third child 52
just burnt five poor souls 40
just change your mind about 100
just close your eyes again 43

just moved here from texas 48
just moved into their first 59
just needs some time alone 72
just never knew what would 43
just never know what might 161
just never know what people 44
just playing into their hands 62
just risen from their knees 47
just share from their labor 98
just showing their heads above 48
just spend some time alone 54
just spend some time sitting 83
just taken from some place 51
just under three years after 43
just under three years later 44
just waked from their sleep 55
just yards away from where 88

just before closing time and 274
just before feeding time and 50
just before getting into bed 658
just before getting into his 47
just before sailing from new 43

just enough money left for 183
just enough space left for 79
just fairly swarm over you 76
just forget about what you 42
just ninety miles from our 43
just talked about what was 44
just thought maybe there was 43
just turned eight years old 106
just turned fifty years old 44
just turned forty years old 41
just turned seven years old 74
just turned thirty years old 56

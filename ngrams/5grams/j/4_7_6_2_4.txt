jest appeared likely to take 63
jury decides issues of fact 46
just because something is good 46
just because something is hard 42
just because something is true 42
just climbed across the rope 75
just courage enough to make 169
just flashed across my mind 95
just flashed through my mind 373
just foolish enough to keep 44
just legible enough to keep 78
just minutes before he died 45
just minutes before the game 44
just minutes before we were 89
just moments before he died 43
just rapidly enough to keep 57
just religion enough to make 210
just selfish enough to want 43
just shortly before he died 43
just stepped inside the door 112
just stepped through the door 237
just stopped myself in time 132
just tightly enough to hold 103
just tightly enough to keep 101
just tightly enough to make 40
just unlucky enough to have 66
just visible through the haze 129
just visible through the mist 122
just visible through the open 94
just visible through the rain 52
just visible through the thick 48
just wandering around the city 93

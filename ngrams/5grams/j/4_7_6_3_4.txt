just because someone has been 80
just because someone has done 52
just because someone was born 103
just because something has been 135
just between sleeping and waking 47
just flashed across his mind 61
just flashed through her mind 41
just flashed through his mind 98
just floated before his eyes 44
just minutes before had been 66
just minutes before they were 127
just moments before had been 125
just moments before they were 50
just moments earlier had been 40
just obscure enough and just 53
just scraped through with three 62
just wondering whether you were 56

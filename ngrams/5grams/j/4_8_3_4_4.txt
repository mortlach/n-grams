jury informed him upon their 59
jury sentencing that were held 68
just decisions and seem eager 55
just examined and left upon 74
just finished his great work 65
just finished his pipe when 41
just finished his tale when 43
just happened that there were 75
just listened and said nothing 49
just mentioned may have been 100
just possible that some other 79
just possible that some sort 48
just possible that some such 62
just possible that there were 107
just possible that these were 73
just received bad news from 83
just rejoiced that good luck 72
just shrugged and said nothing 61
just shrugged and went back 128
just whatever you think best 47
just whenever you feel like 103

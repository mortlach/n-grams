keeps a man away from 149
keeps a man from harm 115
knees a few feet away 63
knelt a few feet away 61
knife i had ever seen 43
knock a man down when 93
knowing i had been there 49
known a day free from 50
known a few years back 69
known i had been only 78
known i was coming back 54
known i was coming here 81
knows i can take care 336
knows i had great need 51

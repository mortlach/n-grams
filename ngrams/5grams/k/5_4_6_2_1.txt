keeping ever before us a 45
keeping their bodies in a 55
keeping their horses at a 69
keeps your memory as a 52
kills their fathers is a 45
knowing what counts as a 81
known among indians as a 49
known more widely as a 59
known years before as a 91
knows what belongs to a 123
knows what counts as a 47

kayaks racing home from the 51
keeper will have lots of 65
kicked away their boat to 87
kicked some dirt over the 42
killed many more when he 77
killed some time during the 42
killed were left upon the 72
kindle once more into the 63
kindling breath must fire the 75
kindly gave their time to 114
kindly taking their leave of 67
kisses were like upon the 94
knives were soon busy at 46
knocking down your door to 59
knocking their heads upon the 77

lad who had never exercised 48
law has long since abandoned 43
law than that which surrounds 177
lay all that night sleepless 41
lay with its trunk shattered 40
lead his age either backwards 40
leg was now grown extremely 59
let fly her whole broadside 68
let fly his whole broadside 46
let his head droop pensively 65
let off with light sentences 97
let out for longer intervals 260
let them not enter nunneries 58
long and too close association 42
long and two short syllables 416
long than for short distances 64
low pay and working conditions 63

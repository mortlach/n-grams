law been once borne down 67
law came into force only 45
law have been taken into 42
lay along some miles from 58
lay down their lives bearing 58
lay down their lives even 42
lay down their lives upon 52
lay down their lives when 81
lay eggs from which their 81
lay hold upon every good 266
lay only five miles away 46
lay only five miles from 47
lay only three miles from 58
lay some five miles from 63
lay some three miles from 47
lay their heavy loins upon 62
lay their rude hands upon 41
lay there hour after hour 135
lead like cork shall swim 72
lean faith these rigid laws 45
leap along those rocks have 135
led down some steps into 49
led have been found true 50
leg over your right knee 60
let come what might come 53
let down from heaven into 194
let down their guard when 77
let down your guard when 56
let fall ripe dates upon 45
let their bass cliff have 46
let their eyes flash when 50
let their good works grow 128
let their south winds blow 44
let these angry people know 42
let what other people think 113
let your eyes glaze over 150
let your face shine upon 117
let your good deeds glow 91
let your heart guide your 63
let your mind drift away 51
let your mind drift back 160
let your mind dwell upon 350
let your mind float free 95
let your mouth cause your 70
let your poor mother speak 48
let your soul exalt your 60
let your teeth quite meet 70
lie here hour after hour 212
lie there hour after hour 67
lie till tall trees grow 72
long been laid aside from 102
long been well known among 84
long blue cloth cloak over 42
long dark hair falling over 216
long dark hair flowing down 92
long dark hair flowing over 40
long days from short days 52
long fair hair falling over 71
long fair hair flowing over 56
long hair hanging loose over 45
long have lain whose loss 54
long have these people been 63
long have your people been 193
long into their adult years 42
long legs made short work 76
long legs making short work 47
long past their usual hour 119
long past their usual time 46
long pins were thrust into 62
long single line stalk slow 41
long their jobs would last 51
long their luck would hold 51
long there come under your 75
long time been acted only 114
long time even while their 41
long time from getting into 69
long time many people have 40
long time will often break 41
long veil like shining wind 53
long will these people treat 125
long will your money last 41
lot these days about what 50
low have their people blear 100

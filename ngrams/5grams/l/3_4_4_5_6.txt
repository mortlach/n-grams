lay down arms until prussia 100
lay down their lives before 113
lay down their lives fighting 59
lay down their lives sooner 64
lay down their lives without 186
lay some three miles toward 44
lean beef into small pieces 79
led forth among dreams become 84
let down from above through 98
let their only child starve 45
let your eyes glide across 71
let your fair hands joined 76
let your love shine through 44
let your soul place itself 44
long kept miss alice standing 92
long open reading frame encoding 129
long swinging trot again assuring 204
long time your father should 53
long upon these turning wheels 535
long will these people reject 46
long years must still elapse 90
lying amid great white blocks 57

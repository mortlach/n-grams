law must have fallen into 40
law went into effect july 205
law went into effect june 64
law went into effect only 49
law went into effect there 285
law went into effect were 81
lay down some covering fire 45
lay down their weapons when 87
lay much less stress upon 78
lay much more stress upon 90
lay none other burden upon 45
lay such great stress upon 90
lay their case before your 43
lay upon their breasts upon 70
lay very great stress upon 800
lay very much stress upon 108
lead forth their legions like 61
leaf buds were bursting their 111
leap forth from behind your 40
leap upon their silver feet 42
led into what looked like 118
let down their common name 46
let down your golden hair 141
let some more supple youth 48
let some other prince more 118
let their eyes wander from 117
let their eyes wander over 232
let these ideas hamper your 92
let those four barons come 62
let your eyes wander from 107
let your eyes wander over 224
let your ills affect your 139
let your mind wander away 45
let your mind wander back 127
let your mind wander during 48
let your mind wander from 162
let your mind wander into 74
let your mind wander over 232
let your mind wander when 82
let your peace return unto 44
let your town habits draw 41
lie down till dinner time 40
lie here safe enough till 117
lie upon these tables like 88
long ages pass before these 43
long dark hair pulled back 546
long dark hair spilling over 83
long days were exempt from 50
long gray hair pulled back 122
long kept their memory warm 119
long peace will enable those 64
long safe from drowning till 52
long time been absent from 40
long time been looked upon 138
long time were looked upon 54
long very much exceed their 55
long years have passed away 220
long years have rolled away 68
low back pain radiating down 123
low back pain radiating into 162
lying there these twenty years 64

law bind souls nursed in 51
law brings about changes in 42
law made either before or 52
law must adapt itself to 217
law took place through the 66
law will never suffer an 58
law will rather invert the 48
lay down again beside me 40
lay down again beside the 53
lay down close beside the 45
lay down fully clothed on 148
lay down rules relating to 60
lay once again through the 157
lay some loose sheets of 42
lay such facts before the 61
lay such false stress on 63
lay their cases before the 118
lay their cause before the 149
lay their gifts before the 46
lay their plans before the 62
lay their views before the 287
lay their wrongs before the 41
lay there staring through the 56
lay these facts before the 164
lay these views before the 50
lay those facts before the 45
lead their lives without the 50
lead these testy rivals so 241
lean their whole weight on 45
leap back again before the 75
leap three times through the 239
led into error through the 44
led some lower courts to 63
led three times around the 171
led your steps across the 72
let other people attend to 42
let rise until double in 1192
let their image fasten in 53
let their loves remind me 54
let their minds wander to 61
let their whole houses be 87
let these blows reform thy 47
let what shows itself be 52
let what would become of 103
let what would happen to 140
let your breathing return to 116
let your child choose the 65
let your first thought be 222
let your tongue return to 68
lie from state courts to 50
lie very close indeed to 156
log fire flame colors to 104
long been brewing seemed at 55
long been gaining ground in 87
long been growing innate in 69
long been known simply as 51
long been known through the 174
long been under attack as 46
long been under attack by 173
long been wanting something of 55
long hair nearly touching the 52
long hair rather marred the 59
long hair which covers the 45
long hall running through the 42
long legs nearly touching the 42
long line right across the 49
long spear while sticking in 50
long tail which reached to 64
long time about whether or 68
long time about whether to 82
long time after entering the 40
long time after seemed to 47
long time echoed behind us 48
long time every effort to 64
long time getting around to 131
long time getting through the 53
long time looking across the 46
long time looking through the 108
long time period before the 52
long time since anyone in 138
long time staring through the 43
long time undoing myself to 49
long tube passing through the 45
long yarn about something to 187
lot been first instead of 140
lot more chaps grinning at 53
low flow rates through the 55
low rise sloping gently to 94
low room which looked as 92
low room which served as 42

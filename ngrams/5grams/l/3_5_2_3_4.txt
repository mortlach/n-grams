lying naked on his back 272
lying prone at his feet 43
lying prone on his back 229
lying prone on his face 58
lying rigid on his back 72
lying still on his back 77
lying under an oak tree 112
lying where he had been 194
lying where he had flung 54
lying where he had left 869
lying where it had been 381
lying where we had left 52
lying within the box upon 75

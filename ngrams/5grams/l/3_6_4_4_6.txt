law should have been passed 115
law should speak most clearly 104
lay detail upon their clouds 49
lay hidden from view behind 84
lead poured down their throats 490
let another pass over before 61
let events take their course 3391
let happen what will happen 74
let someone else take charge 229
let sorrow come when sorrow 66
long absent from their native 165
long before have been burned 114
long before some other chance 66
long before their true nature 122
long before there were enough 67
long before there were humans 184
long islets have been formed 42
long letter from miss harris 43
long letter from your brother 73
long moment their eyes locked 77
long periods there will always 112
long trailing kelp from sunken 40
low vulgar vice very little 42
lung disease among coal miners 122

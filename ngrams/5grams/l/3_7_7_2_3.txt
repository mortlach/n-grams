law applied equally to both 44
law applies equally to all 427
law applies equally to both 74
law finally catches up with 56
law obliged vassals to pay 47
law requiring members to pay 79
law seemingly neutral on its 103
lay halfway between the two 53
led several hundred of his 78
let divines dispute as they 111
let herself believe he was 64
let herself believe it was 76
let himself believe he was 49

lie huddled together in one 175
long alliance between the two 53
long contest between the two 193
long dialogue between the two 206
long dispute between the two 243
long existed between the two 2129
long journey between the two 53
long natural history of this 50
long patient suffering of dying 44
long quarrel between the two 153
long rivalry between the two 286
long silence between the two 347
low chuckle rumbled in his 57
lying halfway between the two 80

lads pass through many perils 48
lady whom twenty years before 108
laid down twenty years before 55
lain down beside their fathers 66
last acts before leaving office 105
last some ingenious tory thought 69

late july through early august 139
late july through late august 51
late june through early august 261

laws having fallen into disuse 58
laying down routes into memory 77
leading their armies into battle 45
leading their troops into battle 73
leaping their trains over rivers 57
least four edicts were issued 51
least step without their advice 77
least three entire days before 123
leave some sterling work behind 169
leave their canine pals behind 40
leave your offering there before 449
leaving their cocked hats behind 225
left here eighty years before 58
left home twenty years before 43

legs well shaken down before 104
legs were seized from behind 56
life came crashing down around 70
life have changed very slowly 100
life were passed over tinned 106
life work without having reached 70
like many another great artist 46
like some little wild animal 79
like some mortal spot whence 43
like some strange wild animal 270
like taking orders from anyone 152
like these should have become 43
like your tender town lasses 47
line will always pass through 104
line will return upon itself 46
lithe fish lighting their reaches 103
live their entire life cycles 44
live their entire life without 44
live your entire life without 72
look into another back second 90
look like something from another 164
look more deeply into myself 51
loss will depend upon whether 59
lost sons forget from whence 57

lady retired back again into 44
laid stronger hold daily upon 60
lame baronet nigh sixty years 46
last bulwark when every other 56
last fifteen years would have 43
last hundred years which have 51
last hundred years would have 102
last journey from which there 49
last preceding wife would have 196
last sixteen years would come 52
laying himself down again upon 453
leaning towards such unions more 51
left wondering what could have 42
left wondering what might have 69
left wondering what would have 67
length assumed their place among 141
less compact mind would have 47
life extending over thirty years 48
life wondering what might have 94
life wondering what would have 45
like anybody else would have 59
like everything else about their 81
like glories wearing mercy will 165
like herself were freed from 43
like lightning among people vain 42
like popular mind which most 117
like sisters felt still more 45
like tablets upon which nothing 40
lips hovered just above hers 158
live happily ever after just 58
live happily ever after like 177
live happily ever after once 58
live happily ever after when 78
live together will enter into 48
look exactly like every other 161
look exactly like human beings 48

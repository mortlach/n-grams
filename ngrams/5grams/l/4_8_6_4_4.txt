last american troops left south 47
last external object seen from 59
last sentence should have been 45

least possible strain upon heart 40
left luminous traces from five 119
less valuable metals into gold 44
lies entirely beyond their reach 87
like chickens without their heads 45
like vultures scenting their prey 103
live creatures turned into food 57
living fountain vomiting forth from 51

ladies from improving their minds 48
lapsed into silence once again 78
latter will execute three times 41
leaders were removed from power 61
learned have married their cooks 41
little boys clasped their hands 68
little nose burrowing into books 47
little reef display your power 49
little worn morocco shoes janet 53
lively faith granted from above 42
losses from flooded rice soils 135
lovers live happily ever after 128
lovers living happily ever after 85
lovers were exchanging their hearts 78

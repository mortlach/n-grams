lasted fourteen days and nights 222
latter returned into that course 59
lawful authority over that person 137
legend strangely wild and uncouth 45
letter received from his brother 72
limped slightly when she walked 65
little authority among men taught 103
little chambers drip with flower 85
little children have not sinned 67
little children love one another 209
little children were not spared 42
little distance from and enmity 41
little distance from his dwelling 40
little distance from his master 70
little distance from its source 51
little distance from one another 1867
little distance from this circle 53
little greenish bell that peeped 52
little notebook from his pocket 264
little relieved upon this speech 62
little surprise when one passes 49
loaded revolver from his pocket 42
looked earnestly into her friend 71
looked singularly tall and imposing 107
looked somewhat worn and anxious 139
looked straight ahead and nodded 51
looked straight ahead and walked 125
looked straight into his friend 54
looked straight into one another 47
looked strangely like her brother 76
looked strangely worn and pallid 41
lowering medicine till her clothes 43

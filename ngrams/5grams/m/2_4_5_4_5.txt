me draw souls from limbo 42
me ever since very happy 55
me ever yours most truly 102
me feel quite young again 224
me feel really good about 228
me from closing mine since 47
me from falling from grace 63
me from falling into error 41
me from morning till evening 65
me from morning till night 2131
me from running away again 43
me from writing three months 50
me like manna from heaven 46
me more about these people 59
me more about your father 503
me more about your mother 643
me more about your people 45
me more about your plans 147
me more about your thinking 198
me some people were dancing 45
me some vague aerial sense 41
me some words like praying 62
me very round eyes which 57
me what would fill whole 68
me when people talk about 174
me when times were tough 49
me your whole life story 50
my arms about their pliant 45
my arms ached from holding 46
my arms round their necks 79
my aunt would have given 81
my book shall hurt either 90
my cell phone last night 46
my duty within these walls 90
my eyes burst into flame 61
my fate faded from heaven 141
my fears again were strong 45
my feet never grew tired 50
my feet since early morning 42
my hair would only change 150
my hair would turn white 105
my hand under your twist 127
my hard writing work burning 96
my having first seen angela 47
my heart about your after 43
my heart began beating again 74
my heart grows sick within 111
my heart which nothing could 61
my heart which will never 42
my heart would break under 45
my heart would have broke 46
my heart would have burst 775
my heart would have leaped 71
my heart would sink within 123
my hiding place from every 63
my jaws would rust again 79
my kind reader will please 59
my late hours last night 46
my legs spread wide apart 66
my legs would have given 45
my life could have ended 108
my life could have taken 60
my life might have taken 217
my life seven days after 79
my life under your power 71
my life where most people 65
my life which will never 42
my life would fall apart 81
my life would have ended 143
my life would have taken 558
my lord would many times 89
my mind cares less about 55
my mind since last night 238
my mind which will never 92
my mind would have loved 43
my most noble lord slain 298
my mouth water just thinking 106
my only child into exile 61
my other bones were saved 66
my poor father died quite 245
my poor father were still 47
my poor mother live alone 59
my rich chain will prove 51
my room again last night 50
my saying anything more about 69
my soul which will never 54
my thick black hair until 43
my time which have since 52
my waking hours were spent 171
my walk where four roads 48
my wife knows more about 41
my wife knows nothing about 75
my wife might have given 54
my wife shall mend every 50
my wife would have liked 77
my wife would look after 45

my book which appeared in 88
my cell phone started to 67
my chin nearly touched my 59
my dark wrist against my 45
my duty would require me 77
my eyes again towards the 77
my eyes could discern it 115
my eyes could discern no 57
my eyes fixed steadily on 98
my eyes might undergo the 82
my eyes still focused on 48
my eyes tight against the 108
my eyes while listening to 62
my face close against the 79
my feet first touched the 104
my feet nearly touched the 69
my feet never touched the 201
my feet resting against the 46
my foot first touched the 99
my hand resting lightly on 236
my hand would tremble to 56
my having anything charged at 83
my having never noticed the 45
my health would prevent me 52
my heart ceased utterly to 72
my heart found pleasure in 80
my heart pound against my 44
my heart seems capable of 91

my heart still belonged to 49
my heart thudding against my 81
my heart thumping against my 260
my heart thumping against the 42
my kind feeling towards the 48
my lady wrote letters to 42
my last flame happening to 74
my left flank assured me 57
my legs would support me 117
my life driving briskly in 44

my mind about returning to 56
my mind after listening to 42
my mind keeps returning to 91
my mind really weakened to 90
my mind while listening to 81

my mouth would condemn me 60
my mule loved society as 63
my name first appeared in 81
my neck stiff against the 120
my next paper examine the 41
my part shall prevent the 50
my poor mother detains me 50
my poor mother married by 56
my skin worms destroy my 66
my soul shall rejoice in 112
my soul which enables me 60
my soul would rejoice to 130
my time writing letters to 59
my true power resided in 89
my trying every exertion in 99
my very first attempt at 157
my very first attempt to 77
my very first glimpse of 86
my wife quite doubles the 100
my wife would divorce me 51
my will often invaded my 46
my wrath shall descend on 101

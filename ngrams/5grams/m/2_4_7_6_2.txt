me feel inferior without my 42

me five hundred pieces of 68
me five hundred pounds as 206
me five hundred pounds in 58
me five hundred pounds to 106
me five minutes before the 67
me five thousand pounds if 43
me five thousand pounds to 46
me four hundred pounds to 53
me from following through on 41
me from several errors of 55
me great pleasure indeed to 115
me into accepting something as 155
me only because something is 71
me some faculty fitted to 88

my arms clasped around my 66
my arms crossed behind my 62
my arms happily around my 90
my arms tightly across my 102
my arms tightly around my 98
my arms together around it 62
my arms together behind my 81
my arms twisted behind my 49
my arms wrapped around me 81
my arms wrapped around my 558
my arms wrapped around the 147
my best efforts failed to 40
my coat tighter around me 118
my coat tightly around me 76
my evil fortune caused me 45
my feet planted firmly in 68
my feet planted firmly on 277
my good fortune always to 43
my good friends around me 51
my hand against myself on 97
my hand wrapped around the 107
my having appealed merely to 63
my heart between sister jo 60
my heart started pounding as 87
my heart started pounding in 40
my heart swelled almost to 43
my hope appeared before my 44
my last journey through the 67
my last revised edition of 58
my last stretch around the 43
my legs wrapped around the 77
my life appeared before me 48
my life devotes itself in 42
my life everything except my 71
my life flashed across the 47
my life flashed before me 264
my life flashed before my 288
my life flashed before us 40
my life flashed through my 70
my lips tightly closed so 66
my mind disport itself at 73
my most fervent desire to 94
my most fervent prayer to 342
my most reliable source of 77
my most sincere desire to 69
my name brought before the 44
my name dragged through the 108
my name legally changed to 77
my name written across the 75
my only guardian writes to 58
my other letters inside my 42
my poor ramblings amount to 56
my safe passage through the 46
my sole ambition seemed to 40
my teeth smartly before my 207
my time traveling around the 61
my time wandering around the 71
my young friends should be 76

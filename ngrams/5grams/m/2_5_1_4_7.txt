me about a poor thousand 122
me after a most fulsome 295
me after a much briefer 82
me enjoy a full banquet 53
me rather a nice question 53
me since i have entered 41
me since i left america 57
me which i once enjoyed 50
my hands i have written 84
my people a good example 43
my power i have opposed 49
my shame i must confess 198
my teaching i have watched 109
my visit a very ancient 90
my wedge i have knocked 54
my writing a word legibly 51

my father little else than 61
my father passed away and 166
my father reached into his 48
my father reached over and 46
my father rented from him 58

my first fearful talk with 53
my first jottings were but 91
my first letter from her 64
my first letter from him 115
my first letter from this 77
my first letter from you 102
my first record came out 40
my glory should make his 58
my grave puzzling over that 44
my hands slowly over her 60
my house burned down and 83
my house mighty clean and 62
my house without paying for 62
my house without seeing him 56

my sword pretty well too 52
my sword sheathed during this 46
my trunk inside your hut 43
my uncle arnold will not 61
my uncle should know you 63
my valet always rose with 74
my views differ from his 50
my vision looked like this 55
my voice little more than 73
my whole career more than 135
my whole estate during her 63
my whole future life and 51
my whole public life has 118
my world upside down and 105

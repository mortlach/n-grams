me right between the shoulder 43
my chief pleasure to frighten 52
my father decided to emigrate 42
my father declaring my intention 130
my father enjoyed the benefits 79
my first arrival in florence 54
my first attempt to approach 43
my first emotions of surprise 117
my first exploit in squirrel 284
my guard against the combined 57
my might against the formation 55
my might against the original 101
my might towards the entrance 80
my mother entered the hospital 48
my notes together on variations 52
my palms against the mainmast 89
my people aroused to positive 67
my voice against the damnable 88
my whole history of christian 62
my words brought no response 44

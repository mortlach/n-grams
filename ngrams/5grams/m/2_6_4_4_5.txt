me before leaving these parts 52
me coffee upon their knees 88
me release time from teaching 115
me something worth their envying 60
me special word what boats 43
me through many hard times 70
me through some hard times 128
me through some trying times 71
me through some very rough 61
me through some very tough 73
me wonder even more about 50
my better years have known 137
my bodily eyes last night 43
my bridle hand feel quite 42
my broken health will never 60
my brother died last night 81
my brother lost some money 63
my brother will ever marry 40
my cattle into your meadow 51
my client into your hands 54
my clothes from last night 82
my clothes into such shape 59
my coevals were fast getting 56
my dearest girl will trust 104
my earlier years were spent 61
my family into town until 41
my family knew nothing about 41
my feelings were much short 48
my feelings were very mixed 61
my french into such latin 119
my friend were here about 55
my garden hose back after 363
my golden tent like lambs 279
my letter into post until 46
my little bark canoe alone 40
my little heart were quite 47
my little ones came running 254
my little ones during eight 61
my little ones were saved 53
my manner must have shown 45
my nerves into tone again 52
my notice some time since 45
my office into your hands 52
my opinion were worth anything 64
my readers will have found 40
my return here last night 44
my return home last evening 66
my return home last night 281
my return there were grown 47
my school days were spent 44
my senses when vast hazes 41
my shocks from those large 51
my sister here more sense 58
my sister must come first 90
my spirit into your hands 149
my starting from city point 43
my station among other human 144
my streams will flow round 42
my wasted life over again 74
my wrists from their bonds 56
my writings have been either 98
my younger years were spent 48

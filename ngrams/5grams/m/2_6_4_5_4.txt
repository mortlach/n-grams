me avouch what might cost 47
me regret having asked more 113
me something else about your 41
me something like acute pain 45
me something more about these 55
me something more about what 44
me something more about your 269
me through room after room 57
me through such thorny paths 51
me without even knowing what 45
me wonder what could have 41
me wonder what would have 84
my actions have given great 40
my anxious eyes never left 52
my belief what seems most 107
my better part shall save 46
my bodily health would have 40
my clothes were still damp 114
my clothes were taken away 101
my clothes were taken from 61
my dearest lady doubt what 54
my energy will climb over 52
my entering more fully into 45
my entire life would have 87
my family have lived here 52
my family many miles back 56
my feelings have never been 84
my feelings were rather like 69
my feelings were still more 131
my former self gliding from 43
my friend just might want 94
my future life would have 71
my jealous heart would break 250
my latest breath shall rend 83
my little girl might have 40
my little girl would have 100
my marble feet could keep 136
my master some short time 48
my measure anew every time 107
my memory will often tread 68
my native land whose heart 156
my native town which lies 102
my needle these fifty years 40
my nerves were jumping like 44
my opinion there never will 51
my opinion there would have 118
my pastor there would tell 86
my pocket from shining shoes 106
my readers from falling into 42
my readers have never heard 52
my readers have never seen 60
my retreat from human race 52
my return from paris five 53
my return last evening from 52
my return last night from 115
my sacred duty could make 53
my senses were nearly gone 92
my senses were sinking into 53
my silent tomb would make 73
my spirit will enter into 64
my summer life slide away 88
my swimming eyes shall break 88
my tender years would have 94
my troops from breaking away 78
my victim were running side 134
my virgin lips shall come 70

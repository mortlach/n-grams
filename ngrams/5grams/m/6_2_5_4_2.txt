myself the pleasing task of 112
myself the world will do 44
myself the worst sort of 53
myself to delve into the 75
myself to dwell upon it 166
myself to dwell upon the 202
myself to enter into the 185
myself to enter upon the 50
myself to every kind of 125
myself to really like the 47
myself to really look at 42
myself to reign over the 66
myself to setting forth the 58
myself to sleep over it 53
myself to sleep over the 83
myself to touch upon it 96
myself to touch upon the 72
myself to write down the 143
myself we shall have no 73

no doubt also through design 94
no doubt find native graves 69
no doubt seen through temple 72
no doubt will always remain 40
no light work carrying tallow 40
no longer call animal breeds 40
no longer dumb driven cattle 40
no longer free energy enough 153
no longer grow without planting 51
no longer have direct access 386
no longer have enough energy 307
no longer have enough strength 86
no longer have strength enough 41
no longer held public office 148
no longer love deeply except 116
no longer play second fiddle 94
no longer take refuge behind 66
no nation will devote itself 53
no power over nature except 65

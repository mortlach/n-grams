no benefit will accrue from 85
no benefit will result from 102
no control over anyone else 43
no eternal doom awaiting those 45
no material step through their 54
no persons have always ready 41
no purpose during twenty days 58
no support from anyone else 120
no worldly good should draw 129
no wrongdoer ever thought well 45

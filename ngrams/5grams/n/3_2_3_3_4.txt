now we can see some 80
now we can see what 270
now we can sit back 41
now we can sit down 49
now we did not even 71
now we did not find 55
now we did not have 459
now we did not know 316
now we did not need 81
now we did not want 99
now we had all been 58
now we had got into 81
now we had not been 123
now we had not even 50
now we had not only 46
now we had not seen 108
now we had our wish 83
now we may ask what 59
now we may not have 79
now we may see what 42
now we sang old songs 113
now we saw each other 43
now we say not only 83
now we say that these 48
now we see each other 81
now we see how much 103
now we see that even 171
now we see that there 297
now we see that these 77
now we see that what 93
now we see that when 122
now we sit and wait 47

now to enter upon that 95
now to enter upon this 90
now to finer work than 80
now to place upon his 75
now to smile upon one 53
now to spend time with 50
now to stand back and 75
now to stand well with 71
now to touch upon one 42
now to trace back his 92
now we could make out 54
now we could only see 53
now we shall find him 41
now we shall find out 51
now we shall find that 373
now we shall give you 47
now we shall have our 136
now we shall soon see 46
now we shall turn our 58
now we still have not 46
now we would have had 84
now we would like you 67
nut to crack even for 72

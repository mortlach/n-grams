now only left him which 43
now only those who loved 56
now pass from one point 51
now peace laps her round 415
now rising from her ashes 79
now rising from his chair 56
now rising from its ashes 47
now rose from her chair 93
now rose from his chair 175
now sent away with lloyd 54
now some years ago since 56
now take their due share 136
now taking away this power 42
now there were all sorts 44
now there were two months 44
now there were two people 53
now there were two rival 64
now these three are mixed 48
now think duty they would 76
now used only for grazing 60
now used only for small 107
now very worn and faded 44
now well into its fourth 215
now well past his prime 129
now were those who acted 47
now will help you later 46
now will save you money 46

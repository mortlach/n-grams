one word having been uttered 50
our arms have been crowned 154
our army during these battles 59
our army have been quieted 50
our best poets have aspired 65
our coming once more together 42
our crew left their country 307
our duke will walk cannily 89

out into great fury against 44
out into more open country 414
out into some wide rupture 187
out some very idle minutes 78
out there came three ostrich 47
out upon those great heights 104
out very much more quickly 70
out what went wrong between 43

own heart will best suggest 68
own lips rising there bubbled 114
own mind there were certain 82
own time from their masters 43

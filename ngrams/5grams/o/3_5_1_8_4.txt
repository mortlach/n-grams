one draws a straight line 406
one draws a vertical line 100
one morning a splinter flew 41
one night a decisive blow 44
one shows a constant mind 65
one takes a critical look 119
one takes a realistic view 81
one which a scotsman will 43
one which i received from 181
out quite a distance from 146
out under a separate flag 40
out within a definite time 40

old cargo boat stubbornly hanging 47
one cause will frequently last 50
one could ever understand what 126
one could have understood their 86
one could only understand what 131
one large room partitioned into 42
one often hears statements such 105
one shall most cheerfully vote 53
one which will inevitably make 71
one would ever understand what 109
one would have appreciated more 63
one would have understood what 205
one would learn immediately what 47
our hearer will understand what 57
our house have heretofore been 54
our still more melancholy task 75
our world have originally their 49
own hands cast yourselves into 49
own pride from humiliations past 73

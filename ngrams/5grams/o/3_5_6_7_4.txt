oak shall gladly descend from 53
old devil simply retired into 111
old rogue curled himself down 42
one after another dropped into 44
one after another emerged from 40
one after another entered into 67
one after another slipped away 44
one could always destroy what 132
one could hardly imagine more 53
one could hardly imagine what 103
one could hardly refrain from 167
one might travel several days 95
one morning sterling appeared here 50
one stage further removed from 224
one which should increase their 60
one which should receive much 349
one would almost imagine there 63
one would hardly suspect from 131
our hearts almost stopped beating 44
our jaded horses dragged their 76
our lives lovingly express truth 61
our reason without employing more 95
our whole future depends upon 54
out could seldom extract more 85
out every public servant whom 99
own right should receive their 114

old cultures whose last vitality 45
old etruscan tombs were hollowed 51
old spinster could have pardoned 50
one instance would have effected 46
one original breed into numerous 96
one overhearing might have supposed 49
one shameful defeat from hannibal 78
our lawsuits arise from disputed 52
our questions raise other questions 42
own fiendish shape those reptiles 46
own instinct might have detected 41
own servants would have despised 96

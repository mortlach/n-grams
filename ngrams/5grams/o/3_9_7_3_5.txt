old gentleman clapped his hands 43
old moccasins riddled with holes 45
one enactment pursued them after 51
one important element was missing 43
one protection against both kinds 54
our ancestors enjoyed that right 42
our ancestors reduced this kingdom 100
our existence against any alien 87
our performer covered his brows 84
our sentences everything but nouns 73
own artillery replied with equal 44
own miserable weakness and error 49

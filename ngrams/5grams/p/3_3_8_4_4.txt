pay and benefits have been 40
pay for adequate health care 128
pen are suddenly flung open 56
poet thus restored once more 42
put his argument upon what 101
put his comrades upon their 92
put his fettered soul into 44
put his notebook back into 67
put his paradise lost into 84
put his revolver back into 101
put off suddenly till next 62
put that nonsense into your 54
put this leninist line into 52

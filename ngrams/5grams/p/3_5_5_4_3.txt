path turns under dark earth 71
path which bends along its 134
path which could only lead 65
path which might have led 111
path which would have led 220
path which would take her 41
path which would take him 150
path which would take them 63
path would never bend nor 64
pay rolls under lock and 44
put aside where nothing can 61
put thirty pound into them 48

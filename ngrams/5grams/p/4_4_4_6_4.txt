page will look something like 128
pale eyes look through mine 172
part five most minute cups 47
part will most surely keep 237
pass away from yonder hill 148
pass days there without seeing 50
pass over into something else 140
pass over their bodies into 54
past life will always give 43
past sins were washed away 44
past there have always been 212
past there were always some 200
paws hanging down before their 92
paying down your credit card 56
paying those high prices have 67
peace have been agreed upon 95
peace having been agreed upon 80
pity such buds should blow 100
pity your poor bleeding heart 62
plan having been agreed upon 104
plan must have seemed very 62
plan will look something like 41
play like other little boys 47
play some rosy little game 42

poets have been guided more 126
poets have done little else 152
poring over what looked like 43
port lids were pulled down 119
pull back their troops from 45
pull down their temple till 46
pull from some unseen hand 56
pull your foot toward your 90
pull your heel toward your 150
pull your knee toward your 81
pump your shoes another time 91

page will burst into flame 57
paid away under such power 82
paid into court there shall 113
pair were again left alone 75
pale blue light will appear 43
pass their lives among books 107
paths from which your proud 54
peace from morning till night 89
peace from which great power 113
peace will guard your hearts 317
peace will never come until 64
piano from morning till night 42
pious lady named mona andrea 47
pious monk might have spent 59
plan best suits your needs 44
plan upon which such stock 43
play from morning till night 474
play from which these lines 89
play their cards very close 143
poets have borne great names 46
poke their noses into every 76
poking their noses into every 206
poor folk ceased making beasts 54
poor girl spoke these words 47
poor land makes poor people 67
post some fatal news shall 121
pray from morning till night 99

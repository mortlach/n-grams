pace which might have suited 61
pale brown locks were parted 69
pale faces broke into smiles 68
part which black folk played 73
part which women have played 85
part which worms have played 178
pass which might have changed 59
past deeds stand thick before 46
past seven months have created 44
plan which would give effect 57
plan which would have created 44
plan which would have placed 51
plan would never have worked 117
poets whose works were little 179
poor beauty finds more lovers 52
poor child might have become 40
poor eight miles from shandy 106
poor indian still bows before 52
poor peter might have thought 77
poor world might have looked 46
port engine burst into flames 66
prey still catch your praise 108
puny human grasp upon creation 82
pure blood arise like gentle 161

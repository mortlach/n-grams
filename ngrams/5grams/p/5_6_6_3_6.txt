paler shadow strews its mantle 153
paper screen washed with barium 108
parry earnest speech with banter 132
passing carbon dioxide gas through 112
passing through floors and ceilings 88
passing through galatia and phrygia 52
pending review unless for special 87
people became louder and louder 52
people became poorer and poorer 110
people become poorer and poorer 47
people behave toward one another 718
people called misers and thought 60
people decide whether they wanted 57
people prefer preaching and shirking 93
people seemed struck with terror 52
people turned around and looked 72
people turned around and stared 57
people wonder whether they should 60
pipes became louder and louder 46
place seemed solemn and uncouth 86
place struck deeper and deeper 78
plain wooden chairs and tables 110
plain wooden tables and chairs 70
power became greater and greater 53
power hidden behind this candid 48
power itself creates and causes 181
power mobile phases that behave 61
power simple enough for common 83
power sounds louder and louder 73
prime always burned out before 53

quarters full with cold water 61
quarters full with warm water 45
questioning over and over again 101
questions have all been asked 67
questions have long been asked 48
questions have not been asked 814
questions have not been found 61
questions have not been fully 245
questions have not been given 76
questions have not been posed 82
questions other than those which 140
questions over and over about 94
questions over and over again 8377
questions over and over until 105
questions time and time again 322
questions were not even asked 75
questions when they were alone 40
questions when they were asked 106
questions will not come easily 67
quivered over them like night 148

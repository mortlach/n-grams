quantity lost through the skin 44
quantity lost through the sweat 42
quarters just before the goal 86
quarters were changed or their 47
quarters were placed on four 45
quenched those flames of envy 65
questions come readily to mind 50
questions have arisen in other 71
questions racing through my mind 95
questions very simply by saying 50
questions went through my mind 412
questions were always the same 369
questions were framed in such 86
questions were raised by some 67
questions were raised by these 69
questions were summed to form 58
questions were worded in such 52
questions will depend in part 115
questions will depend on what 116
questions will depend on your 94
questions will remain the same 56

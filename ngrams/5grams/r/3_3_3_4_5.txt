ran and got there first 67
ran and his feet moved 106
ran for his life until 56
rang for her maid again 67
rang out his finger raced 45

ran off with great speed 68
ran off with some woman 43
ran off with their money 66
ran off with their tails 45
ran off with their women 65
ran off with your father 49
ran out and gave chase 118
ran out for their morning 51
ran out with their hands 61
ran red with their blood 970
ran with all their might 989
ran with her tall spars 49
ran with his best speed 76
ran with his full force 76
rap them with their walking 56
rat ran out from under 66

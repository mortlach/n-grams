ran for some distance before 50
ran for some distance beside 41
ran for some distance through 61
rang with their jubilant shouts 88
read this book straight through 1066
read too many romantic novels 56
read with great attention baxter 42
rear all their children without 133
red and blue spectral regions 44
rings had been replaced unless 40
rot with some loathsome disease 40
run for some distance before 55
run for some distance through 46
run riot among possible dangers 46

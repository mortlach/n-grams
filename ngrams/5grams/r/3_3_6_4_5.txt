ran and flowed like homer 177
ran and plunged their noses 52
rang his little bell again 147
rang that martial note which 66
ran its course from thence 58
ran out nobody knew where 70
ray and gushed from cliff 44
ray that streams from heaven 64
read and learned more about 106
read and thought more about 95
read and thought much about 167
read any english book which 170
read her letter over again 61
read his letter over again 66
read off without much study 54
read that letter over again 60
read this letter many times 142
read this letter over again 74
read this letter over twice 125
read this letter three times 112
read this sonnet many times 72
read with greater care where 61
read you something more amusing 179
real and indeed great value 126
real and useful ends which 61
red and fallow deer which 53
red and plunged into water 56
red and yellow give orange 50
red and yellow iron oxide 42
red and yellow make orange 864
row and column sums equal 62
row her galley here again 133
rug being pulled from under 57
rug was pulled from under 257
run its course from first 41
run them through their paces 44
run them through your fingers 62

ran off without looking back 60
read and thought about these 67
read and thought about what 43
read far without finding some 50
read this letter twice over 155

real than anyone could have 56
red and bright spread their 48
red and silver sands lest 62
red and yellow flags were 43
red and yellow leaves from 66
red and yellow leaves were 81
red and yellow light over 474
row and column headings from 64
run for twelve months from 106

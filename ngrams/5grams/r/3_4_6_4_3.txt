ran home through last year 61
ran into another room and 105
ran over myrtle like you 49
read john stuart mill and 78
read what christ said and 46
read what little there was 106
read what silent love hath 445
read what someone else has 155
read what tragic tale was 55
read your letter just now 87
read your letter more than 176
read your letter over and 354
real sioux cattle will run 76
real work begins when you 46
red eyes looked into his 49
red eyes sticks deep its 88
red food coloring into one 55
red froth creamed from his 41
red fuming nitric acid and 212
red glow passed over her 45
red gold another boat with 67
red hair pulled back and 40
red hair spilling over her 53
red hair streaming down her 121
red hair streaming over her 53
red hair tumbling over her 43
red silk dressing gown and 54
red spot burned upon her 46
rot loud enough when you 68
rub their bodies over with 88
rub their speech into one 52
run away without paying his 53
run into someone else who 53
run into something like that 142
run into something like this 107
run their course there was 40
run when melted into all 58

race shall shake your tyrant 88
race whose hearts were frozen 53
raft about thirty feet square 72
rage which preys upon itself 65
raging flood alike have spared 145
rake could really have played 125
rate which would have seemed 40
rays which sleep there lovingly 91
rays which would pass through 51
ribs crack where your wheels 102
rich people falling into sudden 52
rich wines which flow around 75
road smoking beneath your wheels 43
role black women have played 55
role which women have played 83
room about eight feet square 529
room about forty feet square 176
room about seven feet square 116
room about thirty feet square 307
rude noise might have broken 46
rule change shall take effect 84

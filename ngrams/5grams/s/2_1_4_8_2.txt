sing a hymn suitable to 44
so a good estimate of 105
so a great quantity of 54
so a high standard of 58
so a mind prepared to 86

so i just accepted it 80
so i just followed the 97
so i just happened to 75
so i just listened to 134
so i just shrugged my 82
so i just wondered if 41
so i kept straight on 45
so i lost interest in 74
so i must conclude by 47
so i must continue my 54
so i must continue to 379
so i must contrive to 131

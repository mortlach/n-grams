sea when a storm scattered 62
so during a heated political 69
so give a false impression 125
so great a crowd assembled 52
so great a moral influence 68
so great a moral sacrifice 50
so hide a vague perception 57
so made a large reflector 76
so much a vivid conception 44
so only a brief discussion 111
so only a small proportion 213
so will i never dissemble 101

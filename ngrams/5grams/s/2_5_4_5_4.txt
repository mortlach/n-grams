sea about three miles from 97
sea breaking into white foam 121
sea level rise would have 97
sea which meant anything less 51
sea winds shut within their 47
sea within three miles from 75
sea would come rolling over 48
so charm their lives away 51
so close their knees were 52
so close their noses were 43
so often been given from 194
so often been heaped upon 53
so often been under fire 47
so often laid aside when 54
so often seen dangling from 42
so praying wish hasty ruin 90
so spend their whole term 48
so still more nearly face 47
so sweet such awful morn 436
so tired when night came 57
so within three banking days 111
so would have short work 69

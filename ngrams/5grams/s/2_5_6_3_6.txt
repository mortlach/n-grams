sea water swirling and sweeping 42
sea which washes its shores 133
so blind intent and wicked 45
so flown without his actual 40
so nearly become his shroud 55
so often foiled our forces 48
so often passed long winter 91
so often shared his revels 84
so often smoked and talked 49
so often thought how joyful 47
so often united with imposing 46
so often walked with helena 104
so truly proper and english 46
so under nature any slight 49

sea behind the pebble barrier 52
sing amongst the blooming oleander 51
so active in public affairs 60
so anxious to commit suicide 40
so arrive at second masters 52
so before the driver whipped 68
so bright it almost blinded 58
so called by christ himself 48
so called in common language 89
so chafed the jealous general 40
so closed the matter against 43
so common in modern history 42
so common in modern society 59
so curious in searching matters 40
so decent at public worship 40
so depend on something exterior 152
so famous in english history 135
so famous in french history 67
so famous in robber stories 77
so freely of ignoring history 44
so indeed is almost everything 43
so instead of humbling himself 42
so little in common between 342
so little to become popular 44
so little to choose between 276
so mighty an empire refused 49
so obvious to ernest himself 51
so serves no useful purpose 56
so unlike the dismal grammar 80
so unlike the methods pursued 51
so violent an outcry against 90
so violent to resent attacks 41

sea before this thought began 68
sea blooms that little world 47
sea washes with silent waves 352
sing whilst this shower falls 59
so afraid that someone might 52
so afraid that someone would 118
so afraid that something might 130
so afraid that something would 177
so clearly and simply given 72
so colder and colder every 67
so common that almost every 192
so eagerly and freely taken 61
so famous and avowed under 71
so finely and justly given 63
so framed and gifted could 52
so heavily that something aloft 51
so little had changed since 45
so little has changed since 71
so loaded with disease seems 58
so managing that maggie would 96
so modest and retiring withal 119
so obvious that anyone could 42
so pleased that simple people 44
so quaint and strange looking 53
so remote and little known 67
so simple and obvious could 47
so simple that anyone could 312
so unique that nobody could 40
so unlike her former habit 42
so unlike that lovely shade 50
so violent and sudden could 51
so wildly and eagerly peering 84
so without any further delay 91
so without being called negro 52

sea behind fell combing over 128
sea levels were lower during 56
sea smokes like burning turf 128
so afraid lest peering from 161
so called upon shall take 50
so common among human beings 76
so floating many bells down 1364
so gashed their naked feet 57
so lately been acted there 88
so lately been dwelt upon 50
so lately what would come 106
so little care would have 64
so little when others knew 51
so little worth telling over 42
so nobody else could have 89
so remote from daily life 47
so remote from human life 47
so someone else could have 88
so someone else could take 68
so someone else would have 70
so unlike what might have 149
so widely from every other 44

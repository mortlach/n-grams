sea rapidly rising over the 73
sea vessels from ocean to 150
so against their will by 140
so altered from time to 42
so altered from what it 65
so because there must be 63
so because there were no 283
so because there were so 97
so because there will be 103
so becomes clear when we 135
so bravely when leading on 70
so broadly laid down by 44
so closely knit into the 109
so closely like those of 55
so closely tied into the 80
so depends very much on 62
so distant from those of 128
so distant from what we 40
so diverse from those of 99
so diverse have been the 41
so efforts were made to 348
so exactly like those in 73
so exactly like those of 267
so exactly like what we 46
so execute their duty in 53
so extreme care must be 387
so happily fell upon the 53
so increase flow from the 57
so largely into those of 47
so largely used during the 49
so medical help must be 43
so operate upon mind as 156
so perhaps there will be 89
so plainly laid down in 426
so pleasant once more to 44
so pledged having been no 104
so precious will come to 61
so prevent iron coming to 42
so proceed from tree to 47
so quickly away from the 84
so quickly from hand to 100
so quickly have come to 44
so quickly lose faith in 67
so quickly worn down to 51
so quietly look down on 78
so rambles half over the 45
so rapidly away from the 70
so rapidly fading from the 95
so rapidly from hand to 53
so rapidly when once it 40
so redound back upon it 85
so removed from those of 54
so sharply away from the 50
so sharply from those of 115
so strongly felt during the 45
so strongly laid down in 117
so teachers will need to 95
so totally free from the 63
so trained must come to 70
so troubling when made by 75
so utterly free from the 47

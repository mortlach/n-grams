sat a little more upright 119
saw a battle more sternly 45
saw a direct link between 554
saw a figure coming forward 46
saw a figure coming towards 179
saw a figure leaning against 78
saw a figure moving towards 61
saw a glance pass between 124
saw a ladder leaning against 62
saw a letter from general 47
saw a lively young fledgling 47
saw a spirit rising against 51
say i admire your courage 69
say i should have written 73
see a causal link between 130
see a closer link between 54
see a closer union between 140
see a direct link between 837
see a dividing line between 85
see a further step towards 84
see a little miss returning 87
see a little more closely 148
see a little what effects 43
see a mighty ruin wrought 100
see a trader from lombard 193
set a dividing line between 80
sin a second time against 331
sit a little more upright 72

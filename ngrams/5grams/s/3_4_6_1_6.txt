sad face sunken a little 69
sat down before a little 103
sat down before a mirror 63
sat down behind a screen 111
sat down beside a little 125
sat down beside a middle 41
sat down beside a window 57
saw from naples a column 42
saw just behind a gently 48
saw nothing except a little 44
saw there mainly a prayer 54
say give nature a little 46
see nothing through a proper 54
set foot inside a church 1323
set foot inside a public 52
set foot inside a school 102
set forth through a series 238
set their sights a little 79
set your sights a little 249
she also became a member 215
she also seemed a little 48
she bore without a murmur 65
she came across a letter 146
she came across a little 136
she came around a corner 85
she even looked a little 64
she even smiled a little 129
she ever needed a friend 65
she just needed a little 267
she just wanted a little 98
she knew beyond a shadow 259
she knew without a shadow 219
she left behind a legacy 155
she must remain a virgin 152
she only became a little 83
she only looked a little 43
she only needed a little 71
she only smiled a little 87
she only wanted a chance 86
she only wanted a little 230
she said without a moment 193
she said without a second 111
she said without a tremor 122
she soon became a member 110
she went around a corner 48
she went through a course 96
she went through a crisis 46
she went through a number 63
she went through a ritual 48
she went through a series 267
she went without a murmur 52
she were already a member 50
she were applying a series 52
she were reciting a lesson 172
she were repeating a lesson 247
she were watching a tennis 127
she will become a better 137
she will become a member 109
she will become a teacher 43
she will become a victim 74
she will remain a virgin 166
singing what seemed a dismal 62
sit down without a patent 72
six runs without a chance 67
six years before i became 52
sky seen through a window 112
sum game without a saddle 100
sun coming through a window 74
sun sink behind a flower 109

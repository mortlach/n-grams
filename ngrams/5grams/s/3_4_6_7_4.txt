sat there without returning fire 50
saw much active service during 76
saw there neither feathered game 55
saw those crimes written upon 52

see other cattle wandering over 46
see such riotous conduct among 52
see such theories knocked clean 64
see those clouds charmed away 59
see those higher emotions into 41
see those papers crowded into 56
see your sister suffering from 117

she must detach herself from 50
she must remove herself from 71
she only pleaded against there 89
she said through gritted teeth 2264

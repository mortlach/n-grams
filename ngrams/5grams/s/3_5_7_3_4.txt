see quite plainly that there 56
set about achieving this goal 105
set about complying with great 63
set about preparing for their 461
set about providing for their 49
set about providing this also 48
set aside because they have 60
set aside because they were 176
set people against each other 774
set still harsher and more 199
set whose members are just 222
set whose members are those 113
set women against each other 50

she flows towards her goal 49
she found herself both weary 67
she found herself doing just 74
she found herself doing more 46

she found herself going down 91
she found herself going over 178
she found herself ill upon 92
she found herself lying upon 81
she found herself near home 53
she found herself not only 784
she found herself set down 42
she found herself too busy 51
she found herself with less 50
she found herself with more 96
she found herself with nothing 90
she found herself with only 93

she freed herself and went 42
she fully realized how much 41
she hated herself for even 56
she hated herself for hating 40
she hated herself for having 309
she hated herself for what 83
she hates herself for having 51
she hates herself for what 47
she joins herself for life 84
she knelt between his legs 106
she knows exactly how much 117
she leaned against her desk 47
she leaned against his knee 70
she leaned forward and blew 59
she leaned forward and fell 42
she leaned forward and gave 228
she leaned forward and held 83
she leaned forward and laid 213
she leaned forward and said 723
she leaned forward and threw 55

she leaned forward and took 314
she might compass her ends 164
she might correct her bearing 50
she might imagine was much 57
she might perhaps not have 47
she might possess her soul 75
she might recover her health 72
she might recover her lost 275
she might stumble and fall 46
she moved against his hand 156
she moved forward and took 53
she nearly knocked him over 106
she nearly laughed out loud 220

she never doubted his love 52
she never dressed but once 61
she never forgets her great 72
she never mentions his name 102
she never realized how much 227
she never relaxed her hold 46
she never removed her eyes 53
she never revealed this dream 81
she never strayed far from 75
she never touched his soul 43
she never uttered one word 46
she often brought them into 42
she seated herself and took 119
she seated herself each time 43
she seems herself not half 51
she shall forfeit all such 60
she shook herself and said 119
she shook herself and went 74
she shuts herself off from 46
she spoke sharply and went 59
she sprang forward and threw 73
she stabs herself and dies 58
she stood between his legs 65
she stood outside her door 57
she stood outside his door 70
she stood straining her eyes 135
she which marries you must 47
she would achieve her goal 47
she would believe they were 46
she would blacken her face 45
she would compass her ends 141
she would conduct him into 71
she would confess her love 106
she would deliver them from 54
she would dismiss him from 47
she would extract her four 68
she would moisten her lips 59
she would perhaps not have 214
she would prevent him from 122
she would protect her from 49
she would protect him from 174
she would protect them from 61

she would stretch her arms 67
she would stumble and fall 87
she would succeed this time 41
she would support her ally 58
she would tremble all over 52
she would unhitch her ribs 61
she would welcome him back 46
she would welcome him into 55
she would willingly lay down 179
she would withdraw and curl 43
she would withdraw her hand 149
she wrote science and health 118
shoe leather affects them much 49
sin which brought death into 159
six months because they were 74
six months preceding that date 47

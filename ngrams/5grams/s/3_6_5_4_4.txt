sad little smile miss lydia 47
sad tenant weeps from door 71
saw another strong angel coming 115
saw nature springing into life 75
saw someone running away from 47
saw something white move till 42
say should never have been 115
say something about having been 50
say something about these three 41
say something about what kind 80
say something about what these 46
say something about your work 70
say something which will make 87
see genius sinking into such 209
see mutual light shed from 95
see something which will give 297
see waters flowing forth from 63
see whether human beings were 49
set blacks apart from other 69
set humans apart from other 407
set itself apart from other 823
set myself apart from other 61
set speech would have done 49
sex without falling into love 96
she almost broke into tears 45
she almost burst into tears 434
she almost could have wept 43
she almost cried last time 42
she already knows very well 75
she always lived upon your 40
she always shied away from 49
she became aware once more 88
she bounds panting along these 53
she fairly burst into tears 92
she hardly would have been 46
she likely would have been 105
she looked round once more 84
she loomed again into view 94
she paused ralph said nothing 43
she should again send into 87
she should burst into tears 136
she should never come back 89
she should never come into 50
she should never have been 1135
she should never have come 482
she should never have done 260
she should never have felt 146
she should never have gone 269
she should never have heard 55
she should never have left 419
she should never have lost 55
she should never have made 68
she should never have said 101
she should never have seen 92
she should never have sent 47
she should never have told 89
she should never have used 52
she should never have worn 40
she should never help crying 57
she should never know what 70
she should never make good 46
she should never take food 74
she should rather have been 112
she should really have been 81
she should spend less time 57
she should spend more time 291
she should spend some time 184
she should still have been 161
she should still have four 75
she simply burst into tears 43
she slowly moved away from 45
she surely would have been 286
she surely would have died 60
she surely would have done 101
she talked about nothing else 105
she talked about seem like 53
she thought about making love 76
she thought about nothing else 47
she thought about those days 42
she thought could have been 61
she thought could have told 40
she thought might have been 454
she thought would have been 203
she thought would look good 51
she turned quite pale when 55
she turned round once more 110
six million human beings were 42
six million people have been 68
six roomed villa will rise 67
sky became black over poor 72
sun through heaven once more 85

sat around feeling sorry for 120
sat around playing cards and 58
sat around talking about how 82
sat beside helen white and 70
saw ghosts dancing round him 68
saw something moist about her 40
say something about dante and 47
say something about people who 53
say something about where they 52
say something nasty about him 67
say something which could not 45
say something which would bring 47
say something which would not 122
seas swishing broke about his 44
see inside front cover for 320
see little hawking where she 59
see myself sinking every day 125
see whether jesus would heal 60
set another place under her 49
she always found fault with 114
she always lived within her 57
she became dimly aware that 47
she became fully aware that 66
she became quite tired and 63
she became quite upset and 66
she became really upset and 45
she begins talking about you 47
she breathed again until she 91
she changes every human being 85
she hardly dared raise her 47
she helped raise funds for 43
she helped raise money for 73
she looked round about her 117
she looked round again and 61
she needed every penny she 44
she needed extra money for 42
she prayed every night for 68
she prayed every night that 193
she seemed quite happy and 70
she seemed quite taken with 81
she should again visit them 52
she should marry where she 50
she should never again see 227
she should never enter his 54
she should rather mourn for 51
she should shake hands with 41
she should start looking for 129
she should worry about her 48
she starts talking about her 125
she starts talking about how 66
she stayed right where she 159
she talked about people and 46
she thought about calling her 54
she thought about telling her 41
she thought about telling him 122
she thought about where she 104
she thought about while she 87
she thought again about her 110
she thought again about how 58
she thought would amuse him 48
she thought would gather and 91
she thought would never end 91
she thought would please her 216
she thought would please him 183
she turned right round and 47
she turned round again and 64
she turned round again she 76
she turned short round and 80
she walked seven steps and 45
she wished people would not 48
she wished would never end 55
sit around feeling sorry for 703
sit around talking about how 167
sit around thinking about how 62
six horses would carry you 110
six inches apart every way 58
son should reign after him 54
sun shines nearly every day 293
sun should stand still for 49

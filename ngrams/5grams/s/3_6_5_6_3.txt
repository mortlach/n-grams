sat watching close behind and 94
saw dorothy running toward her 102
saw someone drawing slowly near 174
saw something black before him 44
saw something which caused him 143
saw something which filled him 56
saw something which pleased him 49
say something about myself and 58
seal solemn state papers with 42
see someone walking toward you 42
see twenty yards before them 47
see wesley frank craven and 65
she envies every beggar that 46
she hardly knows whether she 54
she looked right through him 162
she passed under temple bar 45
she played until dinner was 62
she seemed happy enough with 40
she seemed quite pleased with 79
she seemed rather pleased than 51
she should appear before him 56
she should incur slight for 87
she should marry another man 65
she should never behold him 65
she should never forget her 41
she should never forget him 84
she should never forget his 60
she should never forget nor 49
she should never forget that 448
she should still direct her 45
she stands erect before you 56
she stands naked before him 47
she talked quite readily and 58
she talked spoke softly and 43
she thought about before she 84
she thought about whether she 42
she thought might awaken him 71
she thought others wanted her 44
she thought would secure her 63
she turned again toward him 46
she turned fully toward him 62
she turned right around and 231
she turned round slowly and 54
shoe market until johnny had 46
sly little faces peeped out 134
swing through wider spaces than 43

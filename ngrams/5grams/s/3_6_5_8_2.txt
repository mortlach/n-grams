saw sterne blink straight at 66
say something about whatever it 43

she became fully conscious of 99
she became prime minister in 302

she looked round anxiously as 68
she readily echoed whatever he 121

she should still continue to 81
she thought might interest me 75
she thought might possibly be 44
she thought would interest me 116
she thought would interest the 47
she thought would interest us 54
she turned round suddenly on 40
sum netted still depended on 46

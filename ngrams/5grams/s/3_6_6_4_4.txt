saw myself through their eyes 57
saw myself through your eyes 50
say whether england owes more 140
see clearly enough what poor 59
see myself through their eyes 120

see myself turned into such 53
see whether abuses have been 47
see whether elijah will come 593
she almost always wore some 43
she always turned away from 41
she backed slowly away from 97
she droops almost down into 281
she gently pulled away from 43
she helped minnie clear away 41
she looked almost like some 41
she looked around once more 115
she looked pretty damn good 155
she looked pretty much like 55
she passed through their army 52
she paused before miss bart 62
she plunged bodily down like 47
she rushed wildly away from 63
she should already have been 44
she should always have been 88
she should always take care 47
she should become once more 48
she should bestow some mark 64
she simply walked away from 54
she slowly backed away from 116
she slowly pulled away from 66
she slowly turned away from 42
she slowly walked away from 49
she starts before their nose 149
she thought should have been 151
she turned around once more 151
she turned slowly away from 44
she walked slowly away from 130
she walked slowly back down 40
she walked slowly back into 106

she wanted something very much 214
six silver spoons were laid 66

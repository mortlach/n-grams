sat behind females that would 106
saw twelve hundred and fifty 49
say twelve dollars and fifty 110
see neither justice nor reason 40
see sandra gilbert and susan 337
sex without violence but which 65
she almost clapped her hands 100
she almost fancied she could 145
she almost forgets his crime 107
she always assumed she would 49
she always carried her point 61
she amused herself with writing 45
she blamed herself for letting 42
she brooks penance and blame 74
she busied herself with cleaning 113
she busied herself with getting 85
she busied herself with putting 54
she busied herself with writing 54
she changed oysters for salad 99
she chided herself for letting 63
she chided herself for thinking 78
she gently pressed her cheek 43
she gently stroked his cheek 48
she gently touched his cheek 80
she gently withdrew her hands 75
she greatly doubted her lover 55
she killed herself she would 41
she landed against his chest 47
she learned everything she could 59
she looked closely she could 46
she looked relaxed and happy 58
she looked towards her father 64
she looked towards him sadly 62
she neither doubted nor cared 119
she neither stirred nor spoke 85
she neither strikes nor makes 47
she nodded against his chest 64
she partly realized her awful 48
she peeked between her fingers 40
she pushed against his chest 537
she rebels against her father 45
she resign herself and reveal 45
she rested against his chest 119
she roused herself and began 66
she roused herself and spoke 41
she roused herself and tried 79
she sagged against his chest 64
she should consult her father 65
she should forfeit all title 72
she should perform all bertha 41
she should respect her trust 115
she should retrace her steps 50
she should trouble him about 67
she shoved against his chest 73
she slowly lowered her hands 44
she sobbed against his chest 251
she thought perhaps she could 94
she thought perhaps she might 65
she thought perhaps she ought 45
she thought perhaps she would 91
she turned towards her father 60
she turned towards her mother 149
she turned towards him again 80
she worked because she would 50
singing divine praises and walking 64
sit around twiddling his thumbs 64
sit around twiddling our thumbs 49
sit wavering between two minds 126
six horses covered with black 88
six million dollars was spent 40
sky became spangled with stars 42
son fights against his father 42
son rebels against his father 62
son should inherit his father 75
son should succeed his father 132
son should surpass all others 73
son william against his uncle 40
sum oliver stocked his grazing 40
sun should perform his daily 45

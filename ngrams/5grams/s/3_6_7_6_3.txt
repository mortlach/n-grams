see kansas present itself for 78
set brother against brother and 171
she always carried around with 67
she caught herself before she 210
she forgot everything except her 68
she forgot everything except that 144
she looked vaguely before her 50
she placed herself before him 69
she placed herself beside him 77
she poured herself another cup 443
she thought herself better than 91
she turned herself around and 47
she turned quickly toward her 59
she turned quickly toward him 70
she twined herself around him 41
she walked briskly toward her 46
she walked quickly toward her 55
she walked quickly toward him 49
sit secure against shifts and 44
six ragged porters battle for 50

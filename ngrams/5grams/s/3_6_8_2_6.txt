sat through lectures in middle 67
saw myself despised by unborn 104
saw myself polluted by nature 42
saw various articles of luxury 49

see mathews whenever he played 53
see partial pressure of carbon 119
see partial pressure of oxygen 69
she almost smothered the little 74
she always diverted to something 107
she became addicted to heroin 51
she became conscious of another 91
she became conscious of someone 56
she became conscious of something 107
she became desirous to escape 155
she became involved in another 78
she became involved in various 72
she became pregnant by another 79
she became pregnant the second 52

she seemed destined to remain 51
she seemed disposed to insist 44
she seemed entirely to forget 47
she seemed scarcely to notice 218
she seemed suddenly to become 116
she should continue to attend 42
she should continue to follow 55
she should continue to occupy 55
she should continue to refuse 74
she should continue to render 42
she should continue to reside 75
she should continue to suffer 49
she slowly ascended the stairs 105
she slowly returned in answer 52
song without attempting to render 57

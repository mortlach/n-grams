sure you will promise me 42
sure you will receive it 52
sure you will receive the 91
sure you will rejoice in 125
sure you will rejoice to 154
sure you will respect my 66
sure you will succeed in 114
sure you will welcome the 49
swear you were listening to 58
swear you will support the 73
swim they were allowed to 41
swinging her legs against the 40

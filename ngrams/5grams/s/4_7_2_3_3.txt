sure everything is set for 47
sure mankind is not yet 41
sure presage of all that 41
swinging curtain of ivy and 93
swinging dreamily to and fro 79
swinging herself to and fro 68
swinging himself to and fro 276
swinging steadily to and fro 41
swung herself to and fro 66
swung himself to and fro 127
swung lightly to and fro 47

shorten what i am going 54
shudder when i do but 43
silence like a sea that 407
sixteen years i am not 54
society when i am with 65
somehow when i am not 52
sounded like a sea lion 43
splices what i do see 52
stranger whom i am going 90
stranger whom i do not 52
streets when i am out 79
streets when i go out 112
strikes were i do not 58
suffering from i do not 97
suggest such a thing and 84
suggest such a thing was 50
suppose such a thing was 56
survive when i in earth 295

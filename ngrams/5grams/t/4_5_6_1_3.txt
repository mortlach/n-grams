take every chance i can 51
take every chance i get 44
take fifty pounds a year 86
take place before a man 44
take place before a new 396
take place through a new 68
take place without a new 56
take place without a too 62
talk about building a new 370
talk about something a bit 115
talk about something i did 40
talk about something i had 48
talk about starting a new 165
their faces toward a new 47
their hands before a meal 251
their minds whether i was 43
their shops without a law 74
their state turned a deaf 70
there anything further i can 182
there anything special i can 129
there every chance i get 136
there every chance i got 132
there might emerge a new 47
there might follow a new 50
there never breathed a man 51
there never passed a day 104
there never passes a day 57
there prone before i had 44
there since before i was 116
there still exists a big 105
there still exists a gap 160
there still exists a lot 85
there still exists a real 65
there still lingered a few 97
there still remain a few 2095
there still remain a lot 65
there would emerge a new 136
there would follow a long 107
there would remain a few 46
there would remain a gap 51
there would remain a net 88
there would result a new 69
there would result a real 41
these bills became a law 131
these people thought i was 61
these sixty papers a day 41
think about building a new 136
think about myself a lot 44
think about starting a new 119
think about whether i can 59
think about whether i was 167
think people thought i was 53
think twice before i let 45
think twice before i put 101
those staring rounds i saw 99
those which enable a man 102
those whose revolt a few 40
those whose voices i had 65
three hours before i got 92
three hours before i had 196
three hours before i saw 44
three hours before i was 176
three months before a new 232
three months before i can 156
three months before i did 79
three months before i got 214
three months before i had 206
three months before i met 103
three months before i saw 290
three months before i was 1059
three months earlier i had 79
three months without a day 46
three times before a man 61
three times before i can 138
three times before i get 63
three times before i got 480
three times before i had 86
three times before i was 510
three weeks before i can 137
three weeks before i did 45
three weeks before i get 55
three weeks before i got 203
three weeks before i had 181
three weeks before i met 56
three weeks before i saw 243
three weeks before i see 80
three weeks before i was 573
three weeks earlier i had 59
three weeks hardly a day 53
three weeks without a day 51
till burns became a poet 143
took cover behind a big 53
took cover behind a car 41
took cover behind a low 49
took hours before i was 61
took place almost a year 284
took place before a new 48
took place before i had 143
took place before i was 417
took place beyond a few 40
took place through a long 53
took place whilst i was 314
trial court granting a new 153
trying hours whilst i was 72

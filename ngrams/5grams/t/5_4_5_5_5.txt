tails make lofty ships carry 256
taken some steps which would 46
taken three times daily after 69
tales have never since ceased 57
telling other people about jesus 49
thirty feet above water level 44
though most people would agree 101
though their bones would burst 132
thrown down about forty yards 43
thrown into either scale would 41
today well lived makes every 396
touch wine shall never touch 56
tract lies about thirty miles 43
tubes from paper towel rolls 95
types into social class molds 43

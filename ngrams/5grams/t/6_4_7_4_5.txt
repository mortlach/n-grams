thought must finally give place 73
through other persons acting under 74
through their country from italy 55
thunder were faintly heard rolling 115
towering five thousand feet above 42
towering four hundred feet above 41
towering many hundred feet above 44
towering many thousand feet above 51
towering three hundred feet above 40
towering three thousand feet above 99
trails were widened into roads 42
tribes were divided into clans 102
troops were brought into action 375
troops were brought into paris 40
troops were divided into eight 52
troops were ordered into action 60
turned away because their names 42
turned away utterly from music 49
turned their thoughts from stars 134
twenty years together were never 40

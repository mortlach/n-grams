thought about how little i 82
thought about that before i 181
thought about this before i 43
thought about this matter a 116
thought maybe you needed a 52
thought which has turned a 46
through merit than through a 62
through which one caught a 108
through which one enters a 124
through which one reaches a 50
through which she became a 62
through which they gained a 43
through which they passed a 165
through which was passed a 396
through which was threaded a 79
through which you caught a 56
through woods and across a 44
tissue paper and revealing a 77
travel agent and booked a 108
tribes within our limits a 98
turned aside and opened a 41
turned right and walked a 47
turned round and beheld a 97
turned round and caught a 52
turned round and showed a 93
turned round and walked a 49
twelve hours had passed a 53

thirteen miles were measured from 78
thousand dyers have emptied their 54
thousand marks were exacted from 42
thousand minds were brought into 62
thousand people were crammed into 133
thousand people were crowded into 148
thousand people were present when 41
thousand people were removed from 56

torrent roaring some hundred feet 49
treaties which were entered into 72
trembling steps poor mankind tread 67
turtles breathe their amorous pain 55

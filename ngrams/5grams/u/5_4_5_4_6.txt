under some roots there seemed 55
undying life would throw around 45
until four weeks have passed 44
until many months have passed 89
until single mother dana morrow 43
until some hours have passed 64
until their backs were bloody 77
until their backs were turned 90
until their bones were broken 49
until their cases were called 55
until their faces were almost 137
until their faces were inches 141
until their hands were forced 45
until their hulls were almost 42
until their knees were touching 44
until their names were called 176
until their noses were almost 164
until their wages were raised 57
until three months have passed 101
until well after dark before 45
until well within living memory 137
until your father will settle 52
urban areas where land values 45

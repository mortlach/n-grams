veiled a heaven to my 167
verily i shall do it 41
verily i would go the 43
versus a change in the 109
versus a focus on the 56
vested a power in the 63
vested a right in the 81
viewer a sense of the 836
violent a change in the 143
violent a hurry to be 52
violent a shake by the 40
violent a shock to the 219
visiting a class at the 55
visiting a house in the 65
visiting a meeting of the 52
visiting a woman in the 40
visits a piece of sea 43
voters a voice in the 79

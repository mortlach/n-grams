we now have were given 49
we now have what might 41
we now know more about 1338
we now know much about 199
we now know nothing about 43
we now know took place 40
we now make iron float 44
we owe those three grave 40
we pay only four cents 84
we put into their hands 239
we put into their mouths 46
we put into your hands 79
we put some plan under 44
we put upon those words 56
we ran away four times 85
we ran into heavy weather 88
we read their last words 55
we run into such debts 187
we sat down when night 41
we saw among those people 47
we saw many high hills 41
we saw some dogs drawing 141
we saw some very large 202
we say nothing more about 69
we see among wild beasts 50
we see here once again 75
we see none here whose 41
we see nothing more usual 190
we see only some lower 42
we see only those parts 47
we see some herb which 63
we see their like again 60
we see these same people 64
we see your like again 77
we set sail from thence 162
we sit here much longer 176
we that have free souls 336
we then have from which 93
we then laid down holds 50
we too have been given 56
we try what there might 40
we two were left alone 387
we use many other words 40
we use none other order 104
we who have also earned 68
we who have been bound 60
we who have been given 112
we who have been saved 57
we who have come after 130
we who think much about 64
wing and tail leading edges 76
wing may keep their leaves 41
wing with food from heaven 50

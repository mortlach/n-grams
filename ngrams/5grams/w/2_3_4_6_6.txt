we are making another retreat 43
we are moving toward greater 85
we are moving toward something 58
we are much better placed 99
we are much better without 72
we are only clever enough 52
we are very anxious indeed 41
we are very kindly treated 49
we are very likely indeed 40
we are very little better 41
we both must grieve should 50
we bring wood before winter 57
we can also safely assume 73
we can come boldly before 68
we can find common ground 447
we can find something better 765
we can find something useful 41
we can form mental images 42
we can give another person 90
we can have another little 44
we can have direct access 143
we can have little regard 67

we can make little headway 82
we can make something better 53
we can make something happen 99
we can more clearly define 46
we can more readily accept 130
we can more readily obtain 251
we can more safely assume 43
we can only choose whether 48
we can only decide whether 111
we can only measure changes 49
we can only wonder whether 391
we can swim without stopping 181
we can talk without shouting 43
we can tell whether someone 58
we got home before shouting 96
we had been better without 90
we had been brutes without 306
we had been busily engaged 75
we had been clever enough 77
we had been denied access 49
we had been marching through 118
we had been simple enough 45
we had been standing before 42
we had been through before 105
we had been through something 45
we had been tramping slowly 68
we had been whirling through 78
we had come across before 124
we had come through safely 40
we had come through without 42
we had done something special 83
we had done something useful 64

we had just passed through 2651
we had just ridden through 68
we had just walked through 135
we had left summer behind 99
we had lost enough already 99
we had made little headway 45
we had some common ground 55
we had some narrow shaves 49
we had time enough before 116
we had very little chance 213
we had very little choice 97
we hear very little indeed 49
we may also safely assume 41
we may also wonder whether 175
we may call modern english 101
we may call speech genres 114
we may even wonder whether 181
we may feel without vanity 42
we may find common ground 69
we may find further reasons 51
we may have already passed 54
we may have already reached 94
we may have another chance 68
we may have clearly before 42
we may have learned something 142
we may have little choice 124
we may have missed something 123
we may have passed through 98
we may have serious doubts 50
we may have something better 68
we may have something greater 40
we may have wisdom enough 368
we may here behold spangling 93
we may learn something useful 94
we may make special mention 51
we may more readily pardon 48
we may only expect greater 110
we may pass safely through 43
we may there behold albert 47
we may very fairly expect 69
we may very safely affirm 128
we may very safely assert 62
we may very safely assume 54
we may well ponder whether 55
we may well wonder whether 1614
we not poor enough already 49
we now call carbon dioxide 160
we now call genius begins 45
we now call middle english 50
we now call public opinion 64
we now most justly suffer 40
we now must decide whether 78
we read must become greeks 103
we saw what seemed ghosts 45
we see have arisen amongst 44
we see their pretty little 130
we tear down without building 41
we too have passed through 57
we two will wander through 57
we who have passed through 67

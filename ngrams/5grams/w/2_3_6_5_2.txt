we may readily trace the 138
we may reckon beauty in 48
we may regard either as 256

we may regard rather as 85
we may remain nearly as 56
we may remain within the 41
we may return again to 210
we may return thanks to 65
we may revert again to 49

we met another group of 140
we met another party of 107
we met massed acres of 82
we not already begun to 71
we not already found the 90
we not already shown the 45
we not always found it 48
we not become aware of 64
we not expect would be 69
we not looked rather at 75
we now become aware of 81
we owe almost every thing 45
we owe special thanks to 621
we pay another visit to 41
we put little trust in 80
we saw another group of 94
we saw another party of 58
we saw another strong thing 57
we saw crowds running to 43
we saw divers kinds of 59

we see another group of 76
we see another order of 77
we see another phase of 44
we see another point of 80
we see another proof of 117
we see clearly where the 57
we see little change in 117
we see little merit in 69
we see little point in 102
we see little reason to 483
we see little trace of 67
we see little value in 77
we see something which is 163
we see something which we 128
we see sporting about the 75
we see various forms of 69
we see various kinds of 60
we see various types of 48
we see without looking at 46
we set little store by 50

we then obtain where the 71
we then obtain which is 60
we then walked about the 47
we thus become aware of 123
we use common sense in 44
we use common words on 66
we use various forms of 42
we use various types of 70

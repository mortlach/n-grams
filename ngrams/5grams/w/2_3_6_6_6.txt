we are afraid stirling castle 40
we are almost always engaged 50
we are almost always forced 48
we are always already caught 74
we are always already engaged 73
we are always fighting nature 75
we are better served through 106
we are taught another lesson 89
we are wholly without remedy 70
we ask whether matter exists 59
we both smiled without openly 46
we can always decide whether 63
we can become something better 132
we can expect further changes 68
we can fairly safely assume 115
we can hardly decide whether 41
we can release atomic energy 143
we get through without serious 54
we had almost reached regent 64
we had already passed through 369
we had another narrow escape 47
we had another singular escape 41
we had better choose another 41
we had better remain silent 42
we had fairly passed through 53
we had lately passed through 393
we had laughing enough indeed 184
we had passed safely through 51
we had passed through before 279
we had passed through earlier 94
we had toiled through africa 102
we may always safely assume 99
we may assume without further 59
we may credit common report 85
we may expect further changes 42
we may fairly assume something 57
we may fairly safely assume 85
we may indeed wonder whether 41
we may justly wonder whether 60
we may pretty safely assume 88
we not danced enough madame 42
we sat around drinking coffee 57
we saw divers goodly horses 43
we saw troops appearing across 41
we see reality clearly appearing 47
we see traced through matter 46
we use simple random sampling 126

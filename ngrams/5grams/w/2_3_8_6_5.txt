we are employed solely about 51
we are grateful beyond words 49

we can conclude something about 47
we can discover something about 214

we had traveled twenty miles 42
we may discover causes which 42
we may discover something about 95
we may suddenly become aware 56
we may therefore safely infer 130
we saw tropical plants growing 54
we say socrates neither comes 78
we then discover another chain 48

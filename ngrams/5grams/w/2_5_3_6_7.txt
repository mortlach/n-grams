we began our return journey 225
we begin our actual journey 48
we begin our second century 91
we could all travel together 57
we could get better results 68
we could not choose between 71
we could not clearly discern 42
we could not decide between 92
we could not obtain reliable 55
we could not permit european 57
we could not remain neutral 72
we could not remain passive 66
we could not remain together 58
we could not resist including 86
we could not safely proceed 51
we could not travel together 65
we could put something together 44
we could with safety indulge 57
we drove our wearied animals 95
we enter our earnest protest 176
we enter our second century 58
we enter our solemn protest 180
we enter this affray knights 87
we found his cannon mounted 66
we found our fathers following 89
we hoped had washed everything 42
we knelt and prayed together 69
we labor that whether present 49
we lived and worked together 139
we lived near enough together 65
we match joel barlow against 50
we might ask another question 48
we might get better results 77
we might now safely proceed 43
we might sit secure against 44
we never had another problem 58
we raise our voices against 147
we refer for further details 88
we seamen are seldom certain 50
we search with little success 46
we serve our common country 49
we shall all perish together 57
we shall all travel together 68
we shall get better results 72
we shall not always observe 68
we shall not further discuss 181
we shall not readily believe 50
we shall put modern society 50
we shall reap little benefit 71
we shall see another example 84
we shall see greater marvels 56
we sleep are always covered 108
we spent our evenings together 45
we spent our summer vacation 43
we swept with bridal rapture 89
we urged our feeble animals 42
we would get better results 116
we would not afford congress 53
we would not boldly venture 54
we would not expect perfect 50
we would not merely garnish 51

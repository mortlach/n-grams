we could have chosen better 149
we could have gotten through 128
we could have learned something 68
we could have missed something 44
we could have passed through 341
we could have pulled through 107
we could have something special 55
we could have spoken boldly 82
we could have walked across 49
we could have worked something 224
we could have worked through 57
we could look abroad without 86
we could make little headway 53

we might have learned something 260
we might have missed something 114
we might have passed through 92
we might have passed unseen 101
we might have pulled through 92
we might learn something useful 50

we never have direct access 85
we never pray aright except 40
we often feel marked changes 41
we often find melody without 43
we often have little choice 47
we pluck their feathers little 48
we poked along warily enough 93
we really have little choice 60
we shall come across another 80
we shall find little enough 70
we shall find little reform 89
we shall find something better 167
we shall find sundry groups 56

we shall soon obtain something 49
we shall take further notice 51
we shall very little regard 67
we shall want something better 41
we share some common ground 47
we stand very little chance 42

we would have another chance 108
we would have broken through 46
we would have enough energy 43
we would have gotten through 94
we would have learned something 102
we would have little chance 241
we would have little choice 74
we would have passed through 112
we would have stayed another 42
we would know whence learned 197
we would make special mention 43
we would most likely choose 125

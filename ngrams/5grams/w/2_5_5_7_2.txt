we began looking forward to 40
we began working together in 65
we began working together on 65
we blush while recording it 63
we could dimly discern the 237
we could easily believe it 51
we could easily believe the 40
we could easily compute the 84
we could easily discern the 365
we could easily dispose of 80
we could easily imagine the 131
we could easily increase the 46
we could easily observe the 45
we could first succeed in 161
we could never consent to 119
we could never exhaust the 49
we could never explain it 60
we could never explain the 70
we could never explain to 47
we could never predict the 52

we could never survive the 57
we could piece together the 57
we could place reliance on 75
we could stand against the 59
we could still believe in 176
we could still discern the 134
we could write letters to 75
we found large numbers of 283
we found small pleasure in 80
we might easily mistake it 54
we might easily succeed in 40
we might first attempt to 41
we might first examine the 71
we might fully receive the 60
we might pause briefly to 63
we never could forgive the 56
we never could proceed in 110
we never could succeed in 92
we never grant license to 45
we never quite managed to 58
we never quite succeed in 172
we never shall succeed in 44
we never would consent to 45
we running seven millions in 77
we shall again discuss the 46
we shall again neglect the 42
we shall again observe the 65
we shall apply letters to 61
we shall dwell briefly on 160
we shall dwell chiefly on 54
we shall dwell together at 54
we shall dwell together in 93
we shall easily discern the 52
we shall easily succeed in 147
we shall fight against it 73
we shall fight against the 116
we shall first address the 59

we shall focus briefly on 74
we shall fully confide in 52
we shall fully explain in 42
we shall gather together the 57
we shall later attempt to 138

we shall later discuss at 54
we shall later discuss in 263
we shall later discuss the 142
we shall later examine in 249
we shall later examine the 82
we shall later explain in 47
we shall later observe in 74
we shall light torches of 168
we shall march forward to 118

we shall never abandon it 89
we shall never abandon the 59
we shall never achieve it 48

we shall never resolve the 41
we shall never succeed in 3466
we shall never suppose it 48
we shall often succeed in 45
we shall pause briefly to 79
we shall rather attempt to 43
we shall rather endeavor to 104
we shall rather proceed at 40
we shall refer briefly to 394
we shall refer chiefly to 67
we shall state briefly the 66
we shall still endeavor to 93
we shall study briefly the 58
we shall touch briefly on 193
we shall trace briefly the 150
we spend large amounts of 77
we spent hours together in 41
we stood alone against the 56
we touch could comfort me 43
we weigh equal volumes of 91
we would argue against the 57
we would first attempt to 69
we would first compute the 88
we would first examine the 46
we would gather together in 49
we would guard against the 147
we would judge rightly of 51
we would never abandon the 47

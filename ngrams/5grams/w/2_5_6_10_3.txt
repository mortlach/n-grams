we could better understand how 115

we could hardly understand each 47
we could hardly understand him 81
we could hardly understand how 86
we could hardly understand why 43
we could neither understand nor 156

we might better understand his 60
we might better understand how 232
we might better understand its 41
we might better understand our 75
we might better understand why 103
we never become acquainted with 48
we shall always understand each 56
we shall always understand that 86
we shall become acquainted with 1241
we shall better understand his 83
we shall better understand how 217
we shall better understand its 61
we shall better understand our 94
we shall better understand that 59
we shall better understand this 48
we shall better understand why 96
we shall derive expressions for 188
we shall obtain expressions for 63
we shall readily understand how 105
we shall readily understand that 508
we shall readily understand why 105
we shall without difficulty set 49

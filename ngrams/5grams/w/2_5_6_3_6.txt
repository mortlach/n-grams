we drove farther and farther 73
we drove further and further 194
we drove higher and higher 42
we either should not resent 99
we found neither mud hovels 103
we found something that looked 56
we gather through our senses 42
we later learned was called 46
we might almost say preaching 54
we might almost say without 44
we might assist one another 57
we might become one spirit 47
we might deduce its result 54
we might effect our escape 75
we might expect that chance 53
we might finish our course 60
we might number our allies 170
we mount higher and higher 116

we shall suffer but little 450
we sleep without our clothes 40
we speed around and return 128
we still employ our utmost 51

we would behold its aspect 46
we would caution our readers 57
we would desire they should 62
we would expect and desire 129
we would expect our sample 56
we would expect that almost 50
we would expect that changes 112
we would expect that higher 59
we would expect that person 59
we would expect that someone 50

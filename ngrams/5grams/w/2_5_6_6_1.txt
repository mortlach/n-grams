we could decide whether a 54
we could hardly expect a 242
we could hardly select a 144
we could manage without a 69
we could rarely expect a 162
we first passed through a 73
we might decide whether a 51
we might wonder whether a 128
we shall always esteem a 43
we shall always obtain a 58
we shall always retain a 106
we shall indeed obtain a 97
we shall merely mention a 144
we shall simply mention a 47
we shall submit without a 49
we shall thereby obtain a 51
we stand united before a 46
we would decide whether a 116
we would hardly expect a 107

we could always depend upon 93
we could expect little else 46
we could expect little help 41
we could hardly expect from 67
we could hardly expect more 134
we could hardly expect much 189
we could hardly expect such 54
we could hinder dorothea from 72
we could manage pretty well 87
we could travel through time 42
we delve deeply enough into 41
we doubt whether seneca ever 187
we gather relief enough from 63
we might borrow something worth 73
we might expect something like 129
we might expect something more 43
we might fairly expect from 47
we might wonder whether such 55
we might wonder whether there 246
we might wonder whether these 55
we never should arrive safe 56
we often derive sorrow from 186
we shall almost always find 232
we shall always suffer from 54
we shall assume without loss 55
we shall become idiotic sure 77
we shall borrow heavily from 47
we shall derive further help 50
we shall finish building their 106
we shall merely mention here 47
we shall merely mention some 83
we shall neither suffer from 76
we shall obtain something like 80
we shall render freely into 104
we towed heavily forged along 55
we would almost surely have 43
we would choose another time 43
we would expect something like 103
we would hardly expect from 78
we would ignore reality were 48
we would wander through life 41

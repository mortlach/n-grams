we assert persistence is that 190
we become disobedient to god 62
we become indifferent to all 45
we obtain substitution of this 72
we reckon confidently on our 53
we refuse forgiveness to our 56
we remain undisturbed by its 57
we should approximate as far 67
we should communicate to them 40
we should concentrate on doing 60
we should concentrate on how 105
we should concentrate on one 66
we should concentrate on our 186
we should concentrate on that 122
we should concentrate on this 118
we should participate in this 62

we follow our eastern coast 47
we humbly and meekly adore 105
we launch our little fleet 79
we loaded our pieces again 209
we looked for places where 56
we needed any further proof 81

we permit our visual field 46
we pledge our sacred honor 68
we reached her closed gates 79
we reached our starting point 78
we reached our stopping place 82
we review our little stock 94
we shared and shared alike 111

we walked and talked until 40
we walked and walked until 42
we wonder how anyone could 131
we wonder why anyone would 56

we caught sight again of 113
we expect older people to 41
we follow every motion by 45
we fondly hoped would be 45
we judged could belong to 56
we justly blame either the 111
we learned anything about the 68
we learned while growing up 93
we obtain which gives the 278
we obtain which gives us 105

we passed within sight of 303
we poured boiling water on 41
we reached about eight in 68
we remain fully aware of 50
we sailed within sight of 50

we should cross after the 50
we should first agree on 105
we should first check to 83
we should first focus on 187
we should first refer to 81
we should first study the 121
we should first visit the 64
we should focus first on 60
we should judge others by 43
we should judge people by 47
we should judge worthy of 75
we should never again be 376
we should never agree in 48
we should never agree on 45
we should never agree to 62
we should never allow it 84
we should never allow the 206
we should never allow to 47

we should never cross the 40
we should never engage in 85
we should never enjoy the 42
we should never judge the 60
we should never refer to 48

we should rather blame the 47
we should rather focus on 163
we should rather refer to 54
we should rather study to 97
we should really focus on 41
we should really refer to 45
we should refer again to 87

we should spend would do 112
we should stand alone in 52
we should stand aside if 71
we should start looking at 123
we should start thinking in 60
we should start thinking of 150
we should start where the 47
we should start working on 184

we should worry about it 157
we should worry about the 461
we should write about the 58
we stayed right where we 54
we strain every nerve to 226
we talked about setting up 67
we talked about wanting to 45
we talked about where we 160
we talked again about the 82
we thought could never be 82
we thought would never be 73
we thought would stick by 57
we waited until after the 106
we walked quite round the 87

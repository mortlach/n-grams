we acquired the knowledge before 156
we anchored in seventeen fathoms 52
we approach the equatorial regions 52
we compared the unrelenting revenge 156
we confound the different powers 79
we consider as perfectly simple 45
we consider in determining whether 63
we consider the boundless extent 47
we consider the different levels 47
we consider the different methods 68
we consider the different stages 40
we consider the frightful perils 59
we consider the incessant changes 75
we consider the monstrous abuses 90
we consider the political changes 43
we consider the prodigious extent 50
we consider the prodigious number 88
we consider the universal system 40
we denounce the resumption clause 193
we mustered up resolution enough 89
we perceive the different smells 41
we perceive the perturbed spirit 91
we pictured to ourselves lonely 45
we received an anonymous letter 65
we soldiers of democracy return 174

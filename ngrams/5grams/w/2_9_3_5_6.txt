we continued our march across 73
we continued our march through 391
we continued our march toward 65
we continued our march without 121
we continued our route across 43
we continued our route through 192
we corrected our first answer 48

we ourselves had taken refuge 44
we published our first edition 48
we recognize that every system 58
we recognize two chief causes 52
we remounted our grazing steeds 44
we stretched our tired bodies 52

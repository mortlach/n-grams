with you from your home 47
with you from your past 41
with you from your youth 44
with you into your next 59
with you last week when 45
with you must have been 57
with you only live once 48
with you some other time 908
with you some time soon 42
with you some time when 76
with you these many years 43
with you when your time 47

woes that have come upon 73
won him over from those 86
won his life from those 127
won them their fame have 70

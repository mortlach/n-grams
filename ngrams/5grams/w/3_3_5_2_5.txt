with you after the meeting 151
with you again in about 56
with you makes me happy 81
with you marks of honor 227
with you point by point 90
with you right up front 46
with you round the world 52
with you seven of every 53
with you since the first 272
with you telling me about 64
with you until he comes 111
with you until the evening 74
with you until the morning 52
with you until the showing 110
with you while the others 44
wit that makes us laugh 61
wit with which he could 44
wit with which the world 43
woes and wrongs of human 63
woes that wreck thy manly 79
won for women the right 185
won his medal of honor 253
won his money at cards 114
won his spurs at crecy 281
won its author the nobel 49
won its right to exist 61
wot not where the trick 40

walked away and leaned against 82
walked away with rapid strides 52
walked back and leaned against 41
walked over and leaned against 347
walked over and seated herself 45
walked over and seated himself 100
walked over and stood between 113
warned time and again against 53
weapons used and blood spilled 100
wearied hams with large bunches 50
weighing more than eight hundred 136
weight loss are often present 117
whence there was water carriage 70
whether life was really extinct 74
whether there are large numbers 66
whether there are legal grounds 47
whether there are links between 125
whether there are valid grounds 46
whether there was anything against 138
whether there was anything between 176
whether there was anything peculiar 88
whether there was anything unusual 182
whether these two women belonged 50
whether those who stand highest 65
whoever else has given himself 49
wholly from that latin vulgate 51
wholly good being would prevent 165
window upon its broad pennons 71
winter wheat and grain sorghum 120
without giving any reason therefor 264
without leaving any space between 152
without making too hasty strides 79
without seeing any human creature 47
without seeing them would believe 53
without taking any action against 153
without taking any steps towards 96
without their being thrown together 102
wonder drug that works wonders 51
wonder when his first patient 46
worked hard and lived roughly 46
worked over his latin grammar 56
writes poems and short stories 45

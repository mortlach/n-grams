walked down towards these seated 46
walked those blessed feet which 297
waters from adjoining high lands 57
whence other columns rise about 44
whereas other studies have found 291
whereas other studies have shown 235
whereof great numbers have since 42
whereof some notices were given 69
whether other suitors were about 52
whether their answers were right 139
whether their parents were alive 47
whether young wenches have black 54
whilst their drivers were either 42
whilst their numbers were every 61
whilst their shrieks were mingled 60
without aching perform acts which 72
without asking himself what cause 55
without even mentioning their names 71
without having pursued some study 91
without making anybody else worse 107
without mass support from below 48
without much regarding what others 99
without some conduit into space 57
without some support from habit 146
without their consent nothing could 40
without true unities there would 58
without your glasses your failing 55
wonder those thoughts came never 71

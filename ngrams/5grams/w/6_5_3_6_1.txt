waited until they reached a 67
walked until she reached a 44
walked until they reached a 123
washed twice with buffer a 61
whereas others may prefer a 45
whoever calls his brother a 69
without books and without a 76
without cause and without a 101
without delay and without a 96
without denying not merely a 41
without first going through a 645
without freeing any slaves i 165
without fruit and without a 90
without funds and without a 431
without money and without a 482
without noise and without a 47
without order and without a 151
without passing them through a 42
without power and without a 68
without reason and without a 47
without reins and without a 61
without sails and without a 47
without warning and without a 209
without water and without a 43
without words and without a 51
wizard takes you through a 49
wizard walks you through a 57

walked around for several days 114
walked firmly and swiftly away 77
walked through that gallery ever 87
wanted oatmeal and several other 103
wanton smiles his youthful eyes 58
warmly glazed with prussian blue 74
watery deluge that swelled high 63

without defining too closely what 41
without deriving any benefit from 513
without deriving any pleasure from 87
without drinking for several days 81

without evolving for himself some 47
without spelling out exactly what 67
without subduing his private will 104

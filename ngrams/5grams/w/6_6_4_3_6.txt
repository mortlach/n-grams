wanted neither food nor clothes 40
wasted neither time nor energy 58
wasted yellow face with closed 93
watching eagerly from her french 60
waters flowed over his memory 77
weapons except bows and arrows 41
weapons solely upon its belief 43
welled through lane and hollow 85
whether enough time has passed 43
whether someone else has already 173
whether taylor made any sexual 85
whoever should form his opinion 178
wholly averse from this design 48
wholly depend upon our clearly 65
wholly driven from all honest 68
wicked tyrant whom they served 86
widely differ from one another 169
widely remote from one another 218
widely spaced from one another 207
window beyond hats and cloaks 93
window except hats and cloaks 40
window lights were all broken 47
window without making any changes 130
window without saving any changes 90
winter through cold and famine 132
wisdom beyond even that learned 103
wishes attend those that remain 55
without animal pets may reduce 64
without another word and strode 89
without another word and walked 361
without another word and without 104
without another word being spoken 316
without another word she passed 50
without another word she turned 340
without another word she walked 83
without anyone taking any notice 126
without carrying away any slaves 73
without coercion from any source 58
without counting dots and slight 45
without crashing into one another 42
without deciding upon any course 47
without design upon any object 43
without deviating from its course 82
without entering into any debate 48
without entering into any detail 469
without entering into any direct 87
without entering into any farther 93
without entering into any formal 101
without entering into any further 329
without entering into any minute 266
without entering into its spirit 91
without fighting their way through 54
without imposing their own values 47
without infringing upon one another 100
without orders from his master 203
without repeating what has already 121
without stirring from our places 47
without stopping till they reached 75
wonder whether there was something 512
wooden mortar used for pounding 53
worked through their own feelings 94
worked through their own issues 52
wounding double their own number 41
wreathed surges break and vanish 173
writer dwells upon that solely 112
writer should seek his reward 42

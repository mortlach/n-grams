walked should have come into 50
walked slowly back into town 41
wanted something else even more 105
wanted something more from life 65
waters closed over their heads 154
whereas before there were only 46
whereof myself have ever kept 42
whether changes have been made 261
whether errors have been made 95
whether humans have free will 127
whether indeed there were ever 46
whether mister john keats five 102
window frames were made from 42
winter frosty wind made moan 380
wisely turned their eyes upon 63
without another word having been 55
without another word went back 43
without another word went down 163
without answer these many years 60
without anyone having been able 83
without bothering their heads over 43
without carrying away some good 52
without catching some beams from 68
without dwelling upon these less 109
without effect upon those whom 95
without further help from other 149
without number from their half 44
without number have been made 203
without removing their eyes from 48
without something having been done 42
without spending very much time 45
wonder whether there have been 40
wonder whether there were other 97
wonder whether there will come 42
wonder whether there will ever 256
wooden horses like live ones 48
woolen shawls over their heads 41
worked itself clear from those 85
writer should have more time 50

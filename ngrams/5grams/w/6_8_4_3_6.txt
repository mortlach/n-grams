walked barefoot from his palace 43
walked straight into his office 112
walked straight past him without 40
wasted valuable time and energy 135
wastes valuable time and energy 48
weapons included bows and arrows 55
weekly festival having its origin 50
whether machines think but whether 91
whether proceeds from this offering 46
wholly detached from its parent 161
wholly distinct from one another 857
wholly distinct from that higher 100
wholly divorced from one another 41
wholly isolated from one another 113
wholly separate from one another 155
widely extended among all peoples 55
widely separate from one another 90
widely sundered from one another 97
wildly demanded what they wanted 54
window shutters were not closed 68
without actually making any changes 51
without alienating those who differ 101
without authority from any prince 51
without authority from any source 43
without authority from his master 55
without consulting their own safety 79
without definite aims and without 49
without derogating from its justly 40
without descending from his column 135
without endangering their own safety 49
without endangering their own troops 44
without intention will not revoke 52
without interest even for readers 130
without objection from any source 45
without separating from one another 49
without supplies from his master 74
wrists stretching till they showed 73

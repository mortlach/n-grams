wandering a long way from 95
watched a few too many 46
weakness i had for some 60
welcome i met with from 151
whereby a man does what 41
whereby a man hath leave 56
whereby a man may have 77
whereby a man may know 217
whereby a man may live 61
whereby a man may lurk 213
whereby a man may think 74
whereby i mean not only 339
wherein a boy being born 202
wherein a man may have 204
wherein i had any part 91
wherein i had not much 376
wherein i had set down 428
wherein i met with great 116
wherein i was far their 295
whistle i can not blow 50
wonders i this day have 104
worried i did not know 68
worship a god who will 41
written a long and angry 137
written a long and very 53
written a lot and sent 47
written i did not know 75
written i had not seen 87

warlike in our soul celebrates 43
weakness of this poor commonwealth 60
welcome as they were unexpected 41
welfare of any other individual 79
welfare of his ideal commonwealth 149
whereby it has been determined 65
whereby we not only understood 47
wherein he had been flagrantly 74
wherein he had been instructed 401
wherein he has been instructed 44
wherein he was more intimately 292
wherein it hath been heretofore 63
witness to his deep philosophy 40
witness to his early principles 41
witness to two other revolutions 216
wondering if you were interested 127
wonders of this vast metropolis 57
workers do not have sufficient 111
workers in all other industries 145
workers in all other occupations 50
workers in all these industries 52
workers to air their grievances 83
worship of any other dissenters 52
wounded in his most vulnerable 81
writers it has been considered 48
writers of her next successors 49
written as they were pronounced 53
written by him were interwoven 62
written by one well acquainted 70
written in his face everywhere 64
written to each other frequently 45
written to you more frequently 47
wrought at top into flourishes 498
wrought in its mere arrangement 171

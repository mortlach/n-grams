watched what looked like a 72
weathered face creased into a 99
whetted edge gleamed like a 46
whipped their horses into a 124
widened into something like a 40
withdraw from reality into a 59
withdrew what looked like a 96
workers have always been a 65
workers were killed when a 54
writers have fallen into a 115

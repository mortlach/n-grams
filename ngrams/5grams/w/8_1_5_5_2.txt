welcomed a steady stream of 101
whatever a rigid sense of 52
whatever i could about the 126
whatever i touch turns to 105
whatever i wrote would be 78
whenever a doubt arose as 55
whenever a fight could be 95
whenever a large group of 97
whenever a major change in 133
whenever a small group of 55
whenever a storm blows up 49
whenever i catch sight of 110
whenever i could avoid it 92
whenever i could spare the 135
whenever i shall fancy it 213
wherever a crowd could be 63
wherever a grass grows or 53
wherever a place could be 212
wherever a small group of 48
wherever a space could be 92
wherever i could trace it 69
withdrawing a large share of 97
withstand a short period of 62
witnessing a major change in 52
witnessing a major shift in 62
witnessing a rapid growth in 41
witnessing a rapid growth of 72
witnessing a turning point in 81

waitress came back with his 63
waitress came back with our 108
waitress came back with two 45
waitress came over and they 43
wandered away from god and 141
wandered away from her and 40
wandered away from him and 72
wandered away from them and 57
wandered back over her old 63
wandered into camp one day 40
wanderer come from and going 74
warrants were sent out for 105
weariness came over him and 52
whatever came from his pen 108
whatever came into her head 1059
whatever came into his head 2245
whatever came their way and 48
whatever else came his way 58
whatever free time she had 82
whatever free time they had 66
whatever hope there was for 93
whatever life brings our way 48
whatever other name one may 91
whatever other name they are 144
whatever other name they bear 42
whatever other name they may 261
whatever other name you may 137
whatever other uses they may 45
whatever other vent this new 44
whatever pops into her head 69
whatever pops into his head 147
whatever room there was for 71
whatever says less than this 60
whatever these pink things mean 132
whatever will help you get 161
whatever work came his way 63
whenever from hoar old age 42
whenever their army was out 46
whiskers were very long and 95
whistled past their ears and 42
witchery hangs upon this poet 54
withdrawn from those that lie 46
withdrawn from those who are 79
wondered just what she had 112
wondered just what she was 154
wondered just what they had 81
wondered just what was going 283
wondered what else she did 51
wondered what else she had 175
wondered what else she was 109
wondered what else they had 102
wondered what else was going 90
wondered what life was all 73
wondered what made him say 68
wondered what there was for 66
wondered what those men had 149
woodwind type there are two 116
worthless whom love can not 48
wrenched away from all his 43
wrenched away from her and 110
wrenched away from him and 276
wretches have done all they 63
wretches were tied two and 71
wriggled away from her and 44
wriggled away from him and 137

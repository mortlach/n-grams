wandered about the country from 66
wandered about the country like 89
wandered about the country part 371
wandered about the country till 46
wandered about the streets like 62
wandered about the streets till 97
whatever charm it infringed upon 120
whatever could be carried away 161
whatever could be derived from 64
whatever could be gathered from 74
whatever could be rescued from 63
whatever either of suffering from 45
whatever price the traffic will 62
wherever anything is carried into 123
withdrawn shall be printed upon 97
wretches brook thy dreadful look 54
wrinkled skins on scalded milk 186

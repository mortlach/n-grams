watchman telling the midnight hour 44
westward still the isolated rock 46
whatever agony we suffered from 43
whatever could be expected from 184
whatever could be obtained from 127
whatever could be salvaged from 184
whatever honor he received from 48
whatever makes the elements more 50
whatever might be expected from 67
whatever nation or religious body 216
whatever right of property prior 61
withholding taxes on interest paid 220
wondered where the children were 58
workshop where he employed many 48

wandered through room after room 414
weariness beyond what asses feel 48
whatever anyone else might think 57
whatever chance there might have 305
whatever doubts there might have 47
whatever ground there might have 82

wondered whether there might have 93
wondered whether there would ever 131
wondered whether there would have 43
wondered whether these people were 47
wretches carrying their goods there 122

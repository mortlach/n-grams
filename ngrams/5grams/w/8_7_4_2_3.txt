weighted average cost of all 408
weighted average cost of each 100
weighted average cost of gas 121
weighted average cost of new 143
whatever follows from an idea 96
whatever happens will be for 148
whatever justice there is yet 96

wondered briefly what it was 48
wondered exactly what he had 84
wondered exactly what he was 132
wondered exactly what it was 236
wondered vaguely what he was 117
wondered vaguely what it was 112
wrenched herself free of her 47
wrenched herself free of him 76
wrenched herself free of his 199
wrenched himself free of her 50
wrenched himself free of his 64
wrestled together among the dying 42

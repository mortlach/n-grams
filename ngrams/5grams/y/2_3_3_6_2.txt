ye are and whereof ye 96
ye are not likely to 51
ye are not puffed up 69
ye can not afford to 59
ye can not attain to 155
ye can not expect the 50
ye can not expiate it 55
ye can not swerve me 125
ye for this adjure the 283
ye ken but little of 42
ye ken that without my 64
ye ken them little to 50
ye may not perish in 75
ye not one another as 78
ye not one another in 128
ye not that christ is 118
ye not then partial in 600
ye that are judges of 305

ye are not allowed to 122
ye are not ashamed of 69
yea they are unworthy to 45
ye can not declare it 102
ye can not discern the 291
ye can not inherit the 97
ye can not partake of 238
ye can not receive the 159
ye did not believe the 111
ye had not marched the 42
ye may not question it 61
ye that are escaped of 164
ye that are upright in 1371
ye use this proverb in 49

ye are called to be 47
ye are called to do 44
ye are called to the 181
ye are likely to be 73
ye are unjust to the 41
ye cling heavily to the 51
ye get around to the 44
ye get puffed up by 41
ye ken little of the 53
ye may report it if 75
ye not houses to eat 997
ye not pledge me in 60
ye now behold at my 348
ye that desire to be 714
ye that embark in the 108
ye that warble as ye 248
ye who desire to be 54
ye who listen to me 63
ye who refuse to be 137

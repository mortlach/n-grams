ye come and no farther 81
ye come and no further 51
ye have not so learned 1556
ye have not the spirit 120
ye have one to another 833
ye have put on christ 47
ye have set at naught 382
ye have with ye always 91
ye jest for the common 79
ye keep out the strange 74
ye kind one to another 8279
ye know that the english 46
ye know that the summer 267
ye need not be afraid 81
ye peace for ye county 41
ye sell one to another 48
ye will not be wronged 82
ye will not go before 275
ye wrong one to another 511

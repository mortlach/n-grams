yea glad with all my 426
ye also with him be 267
yea more than jet or 40
ye clean that bear the 560
ye clean who bear the 42
ye clog and cling at 86
ye come not near to 55
ye dream that one of 71
ye ever see one go 45
ye fall not out by 1595
ye from him that he 76
ye give him all in 49
ye give them not the 154
ye gods who are in 97
ye have met with an 47
ye have not for my 42
ye have not got the 46
ye have put off the 1591
ye know all this to 63
ye know and all ye 109
ye know him for he 57
ye know not how to 299
ye know not who the 86
ye know that this is 66
ye laid his head in 53
ye need not fear the 69
ye pity any man in 44
ye ready this day to 51
ye rich men for the 44
ye seek him not to 54
ye take with you of 58
ye there are things in 60
ye turn him out of 63
ye were this day the 57
ye what they say of 51
ye will not fear the 69
ye will not hear it 272
ye will not hear me 46
ye will not lay it 374
ye will not let me 149
ye will not let the 44
ye will not see me 76
ye will not that we 68
ye will say both in 43

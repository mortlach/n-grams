ye angry for this matter 172
ye feel but one sorrow 63
ye gods that are judges 77
ye have one with another 178
ye have run and hidden 189
ye have with you always 515
ye know that not without 79
ye know that our record 231
ye must let him pierce 42
ye obey him with spirit 41
ye think that was something 72
ye will not deal fairly 133

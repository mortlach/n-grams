ye came from as great 61
ye came from the holy 180
ye came into my womb 108
ye come from the holy 61
ye come into the land 500
ye dark imps of hell 40
ye ever made in your 55
ye ever once to come 44
ye forth unto the land 47
ye free from the love 75
ye give unto the lord 70
ye have come to know 130
ye have done it unto 59475
ye have done me wrong 63
ye have done so much 101
ye have done the last 40
ye have done the will 4225
ye have done to these 40
ye have faith ye hope 81
ye have heard it said 123
ye have lost the fish 40
ye have made of your 48
ye have made the heart 298
ye have need of these 1862
ye have paid the evil 40
ye have seen go into 55
ye have sold my life 54
ye heard from the north 50
ye here gazing up into 118
ye know what the jest 117
ye lack heart or want 43
ye lack when ye lack 70
ye last leave to many 45
ye lift upon the bier 122
ye most part of such 67
ye must take the sour 86
ye must there in your 85
ye over unto the land 52
ye shew forth the lord 48
ye show forth the lord 64
ye sold unto the sons 52
ye speak unto my lord 344
ye stay here to burn 55
ye stay just the same 65
ye stir foot or hand 96
ye such hate of life 41
ye take heed as unto 357
ye took from my finger 41
ye turn back on your 62
ye were come to your 61
ye will cease to speak 165
ye will find ye have 59
ye will give it unto 79
ye will give me leave 86
ye will hand me over 87
ye will have my help 109
ye will seek in vain 74
ye will seek the lord 50
ye will shut the door 44
ye will stay so late 59
ye will think me very 41

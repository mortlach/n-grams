ye also have seen me 508
ye come here among the 45
ye ever laid eyes on 52
ye feast your eyes on 47
ye have been used to 48
ye have been wont to 54
ye have done evil in 129
ye have done unto me 392
ye have done unto the 94
ye have heard from me 133
ye have heard from the 1885
ye have heard what is 41
ye have lain among the 358
ye have lien among the 553
ye have made void the 53
ye have seen what ye 139
ye make your alms to 53
ye make your sons to 98
ye must have heard of 92
ye take rank among the 60
ye there were folk in 72
ye think good give me 41
ye were born into the 74
ye will come unto me 47
ye will have faith in 48
ye will have good of 98
ye will speak evil of 59
ye will turn back on 50

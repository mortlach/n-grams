ye also were made dead 106
ye best know your own 42
ye come away from yer 99
ye fall from your own 114
ye from your evil way 49
ye have dealt well with 58
ye have done these things 66
ye have done unto one 185
ye have done unto this 136
ye have done well not 52
ye have made your god 45
ye have said unto him 168
ye have well done that 84
ye know what harm that 46
ye laid down your bow 57
ye must take upon you 89
ye must tread down with 243
ye must turn away this 48
ye were best make all 42
ye were come forth out 269
ye will risk your own 58

ye also ought to wash 2414
ye have heaved the best 46
ye have power to save 48
ye have power to take 187
ye have taken in hand 75
ye have taken the city 50
ye have tried to make 55
ye must climb up into 106
ye take wives of your 54
ye were sparing of your 44
ye will gorge on sack 60
ye will mourn my loss 50
ye will never be able 49

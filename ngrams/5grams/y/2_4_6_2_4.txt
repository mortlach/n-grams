ye clean through the word 133
ye down before the fire 339
ye forth merely to show 63
ye have caused to burn 199
ye have chosen the lord 58
ye have gained as much 137
ye have spoken in mine 212
ye take weapons in your 73
ye were before ye came 47
ye were fallen at last 170
ye will marvel to know 72
yo were pleased to want 46

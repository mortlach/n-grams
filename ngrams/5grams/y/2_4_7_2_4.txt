ye have brought no bread 329
ye have brought on your 49
ye have brought to pass 53
ye have brought us forth 521
ye have omitted to speak 62
ye have planned no evil 41
ye have refused the most 50
ye have respect to your 45
ye have trusted in your 76
ye such justice as will 53
ye were inferior to other 180
ye will perhaps be kind 101
ye will scourge in your 70

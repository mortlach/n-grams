ye begin to call upon 47
ye breed go bind your 344
ye crave the gods will 42
ye glory in your lust 44
ye lapse or fall away 66
ye might as well have 48
ye ought to have been 100
ye ought to have done 628
ye shall be cast into 55
ye shall be clean from 234
ye shall be free from 188
ye shall be holy unto 922
ye shall be made free 195
ye shall be sold unto 640
ye shall be well used 172
ye shall eat your bread 309
ye shall eat your fill 115
ye shall no more have 42
ye shall to your lord 62
ye which ye will have 41
ye would be done unto 255

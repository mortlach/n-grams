ye aside and ask it 41
ye carry out now the 40
ye clothe you with the 400
ye could bear with me 281
ye could hear her at 107
ye loved her not so 54
ye might not see it 44
ye might tear him to 48
ye shall ask any thing 1683
ye shall cry out in 890
ye shall not add to 105
ye shall not deal in 79
ye shall not see it 619
ye shall not see me 3891
ye shall not see the 434
ye shall one day be 107
ye shall pay for it 43
ye shall see all the 236
ye shall see him as 96
ye shall see him no 46
ye shall see that the 40
ye shall see them no 60
ye still and see the 81
ye still fear that ye 76
ye women that are at 496
ye would not ask it 40
ye would that men do 113
ye would that they do 59

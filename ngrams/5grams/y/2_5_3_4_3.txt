ye could say more than 68
ye every man unto his 113
ye every one from his 53
ye might say unto this 678
ye seize and dash them 44
ye shall ask what you 106
ye shall die like men 1211
ye shall lay upon them 285
ye shall not find that 203
ye shall not hold this 44
ye shall not know for 44
ye shall not make any 109
ye shall not rule one 356
ye shall not rule with 47
ye shall not think that 40
ye shall not wrong one 223
ye shall read these things 75
ye shall say unto him 291
ye shall say unto them 92
ye shall say unto this 4043
ye shall see their way 71
ye shall see these things 490
ye shall see your own 50
ye would not have sin 169
ye would not hold them 74
ye would not part with 60
ye would say unto this 187
ye yield you unto sir 89

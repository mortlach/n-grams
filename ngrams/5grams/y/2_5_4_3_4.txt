ye light down and bide 42
ye loved only for your 73
ye might have had other 54
ye people pour out your 52
ye shall also say there 151
ye shall also sit upon 101
ye shall burn with fire 458
ye shall call his name 70
ye shall cast them into 66
ye shall give her three 42
ye shall give her unto 146
ye shall give them half 40
ye shall have all your 58
ye shall have for your 62
ye shall live and fare 48
ye shall quit you like 48
ye shall teach them your 545
ye would kill him here 87

year he had received wounds 43
year he was actively engaged 57
year he was ordained pastor 215
year he was ordained priest 226
year he was summoned before 62
year in real property trades 183
year to year thereafter unless 379
yet he did secretly uphold 56
yet he has abundant claims 73
yet he has lawfully donned 302
yet he was discerning enough 46
yet he was singularly modest 124
yet he was suddenly seized 107
yet if that condition should 44
yet in all essential points 70
yet in her princely wisdom 46
yet it all resolved itself 132
yet it has received little 344
yet it may manifest itself 47
yet it was commonly without 367
yet it was doubtful whether 532
yet it was probably better 85
yet it was scarcely needed 291
yet no one original writer 105
yet we are impudent enough 85
you as you progress through 220
you at this critical moment 88
you at this terrible moment 60
you do but properly attend 62
you do not actively attack 58
you do not actually expect 64
you do not actually intend 66
you do not exercise enough 207
you do not generate enough 93
you do not nominate seward 95
you do not normally expect 57
you do not normally listen 40
you do not normally notice 53
you do not perceive something 63
you do not practice normal 55
you do not remember anyone 44
you do not remember clearly 47
you do not remember shooting 45
you do not remember something 184
you do not remember whether 287
you do not seriously expect 122
you do not seriously intend 50
you do not speedily return 45
you do not suddenly become 61
you do not yourself become 66
you do not yourself desire 224
you in his happiest estate 61
you in this intimate fashion 73
you in this movement merely 44
you my own personal opinion 48
you my own personal thought 42
you so and indicate whether 56
you to ask yourself whether 215
you to get yourself killed 109
you to our computer system 69
you to put yourself through 67
you to see yourself through 51
you to this solitude before 47

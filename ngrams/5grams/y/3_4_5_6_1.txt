yet here every object i 49
yet there still exists a 48
yon waving trees afford a 48
you ever given someone a 60
you ever stood before a 90
you feel about becoming a 184
you feel about marrying a 83
you feel about spending a 49
you feel about starting a 42
you feel strong enough i 51
you have given someone a 45
you have known maggie a 70
you have lived through a 188
you have moved around a 45
you have never bought a 60
you have never breathed a 67
you have never created a 151
you have never driven a 71
you have never fought a 46
you have never killed a 48
you have never learned a 46
you have never missed a 73
you have never played a 107
you have never ridden a 97
you have never spoken a 55
you have never tasted a 104
you have quite forgot a 69
you have really become a 84
you have since cashed a 46
you just might become a 53
you make father newman a 51
you must appear before a 75
you must first assign a 98
you must first become a 395
you must first choose a 196
you must first define a 409
you must first insert a 126
you must first obtain a 574
you must first secure a 62
you must first select a 559
you need anything before i 444
you once again before i 126
you said would become a 115
you think about becoming a 123
you think about building a 70
you think about starting a 71
you want anything before i 132
you were asked whether a 49
you were driving through a 69
you were looking through a 468
you were never without a 47
you were passing through a 116
you were walking across a 57
you were walking through a 303
you will again become a 48
you will appear before a 53
you will drive through a 54
you will either become a 54
you will judge whether i 134
you will never become a 848
you will never desert a 93
you will never forget a 45
you will never obtain a 49
you will often notice a 64
you will stand before a 66

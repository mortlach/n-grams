you find traveling about through 56
you have certain legal rights 49
you have counted james branch 64
you have decided which answer 147
you have dragged about london 65
you have painted beauty itself 68
you have perhaps never thought 49
you have trouble falling asleep 1874
you have trouble finding someone 46
you have trouble finding something 65
you have trouble getting through 310
you have trouble thinking clearly 51
you have trusted jesus christ 104
you know exactly which number 93

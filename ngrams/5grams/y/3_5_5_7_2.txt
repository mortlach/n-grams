year first above written by 56
year first above written in 72
year waiting period between the 43
yet grace still remains the 44
yet judith never stirred an 56
yet never quite listening to 64
yet taken place because of 61
yet taken place between the 400
yet which every attempt to 73
you about thirty minutes to 41
you could easily imagine the 58
you could easily mistake it 41
you could fight against the 76
you could never believe the 62
you could never explain to 43
you could never forgive me 97
you could never imagine the 160
you could never succeed in 55
you could stand outside the 67
you could stand upright in 352
you could write letters to 41
you drink eight glasses of 69
you drink large amounts of 122
you gazed quite closely at 86
you judge father clement by 46
you might again control the 41
you might easily believe in 94
you might easily mistake it 64
you might easily mistake the 42
you might never suspect it 69
you might offer candies to 67
you never could imagine it 166
you never would believe me 99
you offer blind animals in 43
you really could forgive me 69
you really looking forward to 44
you really never ashamed of 96
you really still believe in 41
you shall judge between us 109
you shall never succeed in 64

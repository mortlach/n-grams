year which passes without war 67
year would elapse before they 46
yet still streams always run 47
yet under another aspect that 43
you about something before you 71
you carry around inside you 95
you could almost forget that 186
you could arrange something for 60
you could cruise around and 49
you could decide whether you 61
you could hardly expect any 47
you could hardly expect her 97
you could hardly expect him 137
you could hardly expect that 56
you could hardly expect them 107
you could kindly mention now 122
you could pierce through him 52
you could safely assume that 218
you could scarce define its 52
you drink something before you 99
you might safely assume that 44
you might wonder whether this 52
you might wonder whether you 180
you never looked better nor 72
you shall always remain for 46
you shall choose whether you 41
you shall hardly offend her 47
you start shopping around for 41
you times without number that 119
you would answer before our 66
you would deeply regret not 66
you would escape frosts and 154
you would hardly escape being 89
you would hardly expect him 43
you would hardly expect that 110
you would hardly notice them 61
you would hardly permit any 67
you would neither cajole nor 45
you would travel farther than 200
you write better already than 41

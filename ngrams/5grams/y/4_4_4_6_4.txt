years have been exciting ones 64
years have been looked upon 51
years must have passed away 64
years must have passed over 49
years must have seemed like 40
years must pass before even 40
years must pass before such 51
years must pass before there 56
years must pass before these 59
years past been turned upon 83
years there have always been 237
years there have indeed been 52
years there were periods when 41
years these great rivals were 64
years when other nations were 40
years will have passed away 207
years will pass before there 101
years will pass before these 78
yoke these wild nations bore 48
young buds were shooting forth 141
young eyes grew sudden fair 145
young girl just ripening into 186
young girl very little less 148
young lady into another room 62
young life shot through their 160
young tree having lately been 42
your arms back toward your 46
your arms tied behind your 51
your baby will become more 46
your back foot should come 63
your bait fall gently upon 92
your body sink deeper into 107
your body will become more 316
your body will follow suit 41
your chin down toward your 198
your doings from before mine 6947
your eyes from shedding tears 54
your face will freeze like 40
your face will surely show 298
your fair city should learn 44
your feet have walked will 56
your free book choice from 49
your health will permit your 40
your heart beats faster when 61
your heart will become more 100
your knee will always move 50
your late lord rector took 51
your left foot behind your 188
your left foot toward your 105
your left hand across your 168
your left hand around your 105
your left hand behind your 617
your left hand toward your 162
your left heel toward your 62
your left knee toward your 234
your life pass before your 72
your life slip through your 51
your life will affect your 60
your life will always have 48
your life will become more 518
your life will become much 123
your life will become very 51
your life will depend upon 78
your lips have spoken lies 636
your love will follow your 49
your mind from dwelling upon 43
your mind from recent reading 89
your mind when someone says 55
your mind will become calm 47
your mind will become clear 44
your mind will become more 166
your mouth just behind your 115
your nose into someone else 147
your other hand behind your 92
your reading will become more 49
your sins were washed away 67
your soul will escape hell 255
your trip down memory lane 120
your ugly face around here 61
your very kind letter from 62
your very kind letter last 46
your wife these twenty years 57
your work will become more 176
your young heart beyond what 153
youth have ever homely wits 680

yards if we had chosen 95
yards of the long island 72
yards of the path before 164
yards of the two houses 55
yawning in the old building 46
yelling at me for something 65
yeoman of the old school 58
yield in the near future 196
yield it to yon cirque 112
yield of the death duties 69
yield of the tax system 146
yield to my own feelings 114
yield to the new spirit 107
yours in the near future 41

yellow dust rising from the 49
yellow eyes away past me 41
yellow eyes were full of 48
yellow glow coming from the 53
yellow like some sort of 51
yellow lions come down to 149
yellow moon rose over the 54
yellow tone came into the 197
yonder baby just able to 157
yonder pine look like the 113
younger boys were sent to 73
younger days there used to 80
younger ones were able to 57
younger ones were glad to 59
younger ones were sent to 71
younger poets have gone to 50
younger sons went into the 54
younger sons were bred to 45
younger sons were left to 45
younger sons were sent to 47
younger years were sent by 118
